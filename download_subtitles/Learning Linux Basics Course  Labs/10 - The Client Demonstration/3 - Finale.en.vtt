00:00:01.293 --> 00:00:06.452
The team--
Andrew, Bob, Donald, Amira, Aditi--

2
00:00:06.674 --> 00:00:09.198
are celebrating the successful
completion of

3
00:00:09.269 --> 00:00:11.651
the phase one of Project Mercury.

4
00:00:11.907 --> 00:00:14.273
Dave has been invited as well.

5
00:00:14.694 --> 00:00:18.672
"Excellent work, team.
The clients were very impressed

6
00:00:18.751 --> 00:00:20.427
by the demonstration today.

7
00:00:20.596 --> 00:00:26.178
Phase one of this project
is now complete," says Andrew.

8
00:00:26.693 --> 00:00:32.439
"Special congratulations to Bob.
Fine work, indeed," adds Donald.

9
00:00:32.669 --> 00:00:34.185
"Good job, Bob.

10
00:00:34.399 --> 00:00:38.304
You have picked up the basics
of Linux very quickly.

11
00:00:38.607 --> 00:00:43.107
Perhaps it's time to attempt
the Linux Essentials certification.

12
00:00:43.434 --> 00:00:47.649
You already know more than
60% of the concepts already,"

13
00:00:47.936 --> 00:00:50.595
says Dave, winking at him.

14
00:00:51.815 --> 00:00:53.188
"That's a good idea.

15
00:00:53.411 --> 00:00:55.760
I should consider
getting the certification

16
00:00:55.847 --> 00:00:59.680
before the next phase starts,"
Bob thinks to himself.

17
00:01:00.259 --> 00:01:04.053
Before leaving, Donald has a word
in private with Bob.

18
00:01:04.340 --> 00:01:06.595
He says, "I am sorry, Bob.

19
00:01:06.834 --> 00:01:10.390
I have not been able to contribute
much in this phase of the project.

20
00:01:10.688 --> 00:01:13.870
I've been working overtime every day
for the past two months

21
00:01:13.926 --> 00:01:16.728
to get Project Sapphire
over the line,

22
00:01:17.037 --> 00:01:20.069
but I knew you would be able
to handle this by yourself,

23
00:01:20.323 --> 00:01:23.291
especially after the way you handled
the escalation calls

24
00:01:23.347 --> 00:01:25.831
for Project Sapphire
in the beginning."

25
00:01:26.202 --> 00:01:30.004
Bob looks at him in surprise,
but is very relieved.

26
00:01:30.334 --> 00:01:31.445
"Thanks, Donald.

27
00:01:31.636 --> 00:01:35.279
I can't thank you enough for all
the assistance with troubleshooting.

28
00:01:35.537 --> 00:01:39.371
I couldn't have done it without you,"
says Bob.

29
00:01:40.204 --> 00:01:42.419
Donald smiles and continues,

30
00:01:42.800 --> 00:01:45.172
"With Phase 2
being in a couple of weeks,

31
00:01:45.363 --> 00:01:48.380
you will see a lot more involvement
from me.

32
00:01:49.014 --> 00:01:54.180
I am really looking forward to us
working together," says Donald.

33
00:01:56.453 --> 00:01:59.533
"Almost didn't recognize you
there, Bob."

34
00:01:59.923 --> 00:02:04.042
Startled, Bob looks up,
waking from his daydream.

35
00:02:04.351 --> 00:02:08.614
He sees Dave waving at him while
walking into the train compartment.

36
00:02:08.983 --> 00:02:13.603
Bob was on his way back home,
eyes glued to the mobile screen.

37
00:02:13.963 --> 00:02:17.693
He was reading through
all the client appreciation emails

38
00:02:17.812 --> 00:02:19.876
and feeling pleased with himself.

39
00:02:20.115 --> 00:02:22.805
"Hi, Dave,
there's an empty seat here,"

40
00:02:23.078 --> 00:02:25.960
says Bob, calling Dave over.

41
00:02:26.355 --> 00:02:28.688
"I lost you
after our little get together.

42
00:02:28.839 --> 00:02:30.742
Did you have to go back
to the office?"

43
00:02:30.910 --> 00:02:34.696
"Sorry about that.
Yes, I had to leave in a hurry.

44
00:02:34.910 --> 00:02:38.379
I was asked to join
an urgent infrastructure meeting,"

45
00:02:38.616 --> 00:02:41.768
says Dave, sitting down beside Bob.

46
00:02:42.153 --> 00:02:45.343
"Things are moving much faster
than we anticipated.

47
00:02:45.586 --> 00:02:48.809
We are putting together
a small pilot DevOps team

48
00:02:48.872 --> 00:02:51.500
for phase two
of the Project Mercury."

49
00:02:51.799 --> 00:02:55.259
"Wow, really?" gasps Bob.

50
00:02:55.537 --> 00:02:59.109
"Yes.
In fact, I've been asked to lead it,

51
00:02:59.370 --> 00:03:03.370
and guess who I'm going to ask
to join the team?"

52
00:03:03.656 --> 00:03:07.871
"More for me to learn?"
smiles Bob in anticipation.

53
00:03:08.173 --> 00:03:13.180
"Only if you are interested.
No pressure," says Dave.

54
00:03:13.530 --> 00:03:16.783
"Absolutely," exclaims Bob.

55
00:03:17.132 --> 00:03:19.966
"Fantastic.
Take it from me, Bob,

56
00:03:20.188 --> 00:03:23.538
in this line of work,
the learning never stops.

57
00:03:23.774 --> 00:03:27.870
I always take it as a good thing,"
Dave continues.

58
00:03:28.236 --> 00:03:32.267
"There are no limits to what
you can achieve, my young friend.

59
00:03:32.553 --> 00:03:35.061
Things are changing rapidly
every day.

60
00:03:35.263 --> 00:03:39.294
It is essential that we adopt
the latest trends in technology,

61
00:03:39.474 --> 00:03:42.514
such as cloud computing and DevOps.

62
00:03:42.729 --> 00:03:44.697
Keep up with your current attitude,

63
00:03:44.840 --> 00:03:49.775
stay ahead of the curve,
and you will reach far," says Dave.

64
00:03:50.228 --> 00:03:51.275
"Thanks, Dave.

65
00:03:51.546 --> 00:03:55.553
I can't wait to get started,"
says Bob excitedly.
