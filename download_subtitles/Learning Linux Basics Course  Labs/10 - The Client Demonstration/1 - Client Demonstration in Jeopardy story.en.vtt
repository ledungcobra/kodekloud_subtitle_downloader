1
00:00:01.020 --> 00:00:05.120
July 15th, six hours before
the client meeting.

2
00:00:06.550 --> 00:00:09.250
Bob had been working the entire weekend

3
00:00:09.250 --> 00:00:12.650
trying to get his application
to work on the dev servers.

4
00:00:13.220 --> 00:00:15.650
It works perfectly on his laptop.

5
00:00:16.100 --> 00:00:19.650
He had even added the extra features
the clients asked for,

6
00:00:20.070 --> 00:00:21.600
but on the dev servers,

7
00:00:21.600 --> 00:00:25.500
he is seeing a bunch of errors when
he tries to start the application.

8
00:00:26.370 --> 00:00:30.470
He works all night, but he is not
able to fix it by morning.

9
00:00:31.550 --> 00:00:36.270
With time running out, he reluctantly
informs Andrew about the situation.

10
00:00:37.370 --> 00:00:40.450
Andrew calls for a WAR meeting at 8:00 AM.

11
00:00:40.920 --> 00:00:43.070
He leaves Donald in charge of the meeting

12
00:00:43.250 --> 00:00:46.800
while attending to a call from someone
from the higher management.

13
00:00:47.550 --> 00:00:50.900
He does not look happy at all.

14
00:00:51.900 --> 00:00:53.870
Bob is sweating profusely.

15
00:00:54.920 --> 00:00:56.020
"The WAR room.

16
00:00:56.500 --> 00:01:00.070
The one place I did not want to ever be in

17
00:01:00.420 --> 00:01:03.770
especially this early in my career,"
Bob thought.

18
00:01:04.750 --> 00:01:06.950
He felt as if he was on trial.

19
00:01:07.400 --> 00:01:10.750
The next few moments going to decide his fate.

20
00:01:11.700 --> 00:01:15.400
He takes a quick look at Andrew
who is pacing around nervously.

21
00:01:16.400 --> 00:01:17.900
"Not looking good.

22
00:01:18.270 --> 00:01:23.100
I have to fix this ASAP or I might get fired,"
thinks Bob.

23
00:01:24.120 --> 00:01:26.870
The client demonstration was at 10:00 AM.

24
00:01:27.420 --> 00:01:29.370
Bob glances at his watch.

25
00:01:29.600 --> 00:01:31.650
It was 8:50 AM.

26
00:01:32.070 --> 00:01:35.370
A little more than an hour until the client demonstration,

27
00:01:36.250 --> 00:01:39.750
Bob shuddered at the thought of
having nothing to show during the call.

28
00:01:40.520 --> 00:01:42.320
"I cannot let my team down.

29
00:01:42.920 --> 00:01:46.650
What am I missing? I am sure the code is correct.

30
00:01:47.020 --> 00:01:49.600
Why isn't this darn thing working anymore?"

31
00:01:50.270 --> 00:01:51.350
Bob says,

32
00:01:51.500 --> 00:01:53.720
trying to open his web application.

33
00:01:54.300 --> 00:01:55.600
Is it the network?

34
00:01:55.920 --> 00:02:00.900
Is it some permission issue
or was it something else entirely?

35
00:02:01.770 --> 00:02:03.320
He had no clue.

36
00:02:03.950 --> 00:02:05.500
He was panicking now.

37
00:02:06.350 --> 00:02:10.320
Bob steals a quick glance at
Donald who is surprisingly calm.

38
00:02:11.000 --> 00:02:13.520
"All right, now. No need to worry yet.

39
00:02:13.900 --> 00:02:17.220
We still have time to save the day,"
says Donald.

40
00:02:18.070 --> 00:02:20.150
For the first time in his short career,

41
00:02:20.150 --> 00:02:23.400
Bob finds Donald's presence to be reassuring.

42
00:02:24.000 --> 00:02:27.200
"Since everything is working
as expected on your laptop,

43
00:02:27.420 --> 00:02:29.500
we can rule out an issue with the code.

44
00:02:29.870 --> 00:02:32.820
Let's narrow it down to
the development environment.

45
00:02:33.170 --> 00:02:36.300
Perhaps the network,
environmental dependencies,

46
00:02:36.770 --> 00:02:40.500
or maybe an issue with
the configuration," he adds.

47
00:02:41.900 --> 00:02:47.620
For the next hour, Bob and Donald go through
Fall the possibilities one after the other.

48
00:02:49.850 --> 00:02:52.120
"Let's go over the difference
between the working

49
00:02:52.120 --> 00:02:54.700
and the broken environments," says Donald.

50
00:02:55.270 --> 00:02:57.900
"Have you checked the actual
network connectivity

51
00:02:57.900 --> 00:03:00.000
between the app and the DB servers?

52
00:03:00.170 --> 00:03:01.670
Are the ports open?"

53
00:03:02.200 --> 00:03:03.170
"Yes.

54
00:03:03.500 --> 00:03:05.400
I had them checked by jacqui.

55
00:03:05.720 --> 00:03:11.320
I also ran a telnet test and found
the connection to work," replies Bob.

56
00:03:12.400 --> 00:03:13.870
"How about the permissions?

57
00:03:13.870 --> 00:03:16.320
Which user are you trying to run it as?"

58
00:03:16.770 --> 00:03:18.120
asks Donald.

59
00:03:18.870 --> 00:03:20.550
"I thought of that too.

60
00:03:20.750 --> 00:03:24.270
On my laptop, I am running the app
with my own user account,

61
00:03:24.620 --> 00:03:26.020
but in the dev setup,

62
00:03:26.020 --> 00:03:28.820
I have created a service account called Mercury

63
00:03:29.020 --> 00:03:32.570
and I'm trying to run it with this user,"
Bob replies.

64
00:03:33.570 --> 00:03:36.670
Bob shows Donald an error
message on his screen.

65
00:03:37.570 --> 00:03:39.470
"From this particular error,

66
00:03:39.470 --> 00:03:43.170
I still think the app has trouble
connecting to the database,

67
00:03:43.650 --> 00:03:47.550
but, as I said, the ports are open
between the two servers".

68
00:03:48.370 --> 00:03:50.700
All of a sudden it hit him.

69
00:03:51.220 --> 00:03:53.620
Bob freezes for a few seconds.

70
00:03:54.170 --> 00:03:56.320
He knew what the solution was.

71
00:03:56.950 --> 00:03:58.850
"How could I have missed that?"

72
00:03:59.450 --> 00:04:02.600
He thinks to himself, sighing in relief.

73
00:04:03.250 --> 00:04:06.550
"I have got it just in the nick of time too.

74
00:04:07.000 --> 00:04:09.270
I have one hour to get it running,"

75
00:04:09.600 --> 00:04:11.970
Bob says triumphantly.
