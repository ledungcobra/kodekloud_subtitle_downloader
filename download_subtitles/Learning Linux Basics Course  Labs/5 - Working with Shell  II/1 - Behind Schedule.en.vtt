00:00:00.475 --> 00:00:05.525
July 2nd, 10:00AM, 12 days before the demo.

2
00:00:07.875 --> 00:00:12.700
Bob, Andrew and Amira are on a conference call
for their weekly team meeting.

3
00:00:13.400 --> 00:00:15.275
Andrew sounds irritated. “

4
00:00:16.225 --> 00:00:18.450
Three back-to-back escalations,

5
00:00:18.675 --> 00:00:23.000
so many issues with one of our
other projects called Project Sapphire,”

6
00:00:23.675 --> 00:00:27.100
says Andrew, “I am tired of it.

7
00:00:27.650 --> 00:00:30.950
Luckily, I have Donald
managing the situation for me.

8
00:00:31.250 --> 00:00:35.125
He is doing a fantastic job,” he says in relief.

9
00:00:36.200 --> 00:00:38.700
“Right, tell me some good news, Bob.

10
00:00:39.000 --> 00:00:41.550
How are we moving along with Project Mercury?

11
00:00:41.975 --> 00:00:45.175
I hope you have been able to
make some progress on your laptop."

12
00:00:46.050 --> 00:00:50.350
"Well, Andrew, I have just started
looking into the design documents

13
00:00:50.550 --> 00:00:53.750
and I'm trying to figure out
how to deploy it on my machine.

14
00:00:54.300 --> 00:00:57.550
I've been helping out with
the issues for Project Sapphire."

15
00:00:58.525 --> 00:01:02.675
Andrew stares at Bob for a few seconds
and then looks at Amira.

16
00:01:03.500 --> 00:01:05.725
"That's not what I wanted to hear.

17
00:01:06.175 --> 00:01:10.425
Donald told me that he handed you
the design documents last Wednesday.

18
00:01:10.775 --> 00:01:14.900
You were supposed to migrate the
template code to your laptop this week."

19
00:01:16.100 --> 00:01:19.250
"Well, he did not tell me," thinks Bob.

20
00:01:19.600 --> 00:01:22.475
"In fact, he has told me nothing at all.

21
00:01:23.050 --> 00:01:25.675
What template code is he talking about?"

22
00:01:26.825 --> 00:01:29.225
Bob refrains from complaining.

23
00:01:30.225 --> 00:01:35.975
"Amira, I want you to setup biweekly meetings
and sort this out," says Andrew.

24
00:01:36.750 --> 00:01:42.775
"Understood. Do you also want me to send you
a daily report of the progress?" asks Amira.

25
00:01:43.475 --> 00:01:46.025
"Yes, please," says Andrew.

26
00:01:46.525 --> 00:01:49.400
“Let me know if there are any showstoppers.

27
00:01:49.400 --> 00:01:54.450
It is crucial that we have everything
ready and working for phase one."

28
00:01:55.125 --> 00:01:57.225
"Bob," he continues,

29
00:01:57.525 --> 00:02:00.375
“It's great that you were helping out
with escalations,

30
00:02:00.625 --> 00:02:03.300
but that's not your number one priority.

31
00:02:03.600 --> 00:02:06.400
I want you to focus on Project Mercury.

32
00:02:07.000 --> 00:02:12.025
Follow Donald's guidance and get the
application running on your laptop by Monday.

33
00:02:12.475 --> 00:02:17.725
This will give us one week to test the
application and push it to the dev servers."

34
00:02:18.700 --> 00:02:22.425
"Sure, Andrew, I will make sure
that it's completed on time."

35
00:02:25.400 --> 00:02:30.100
July 3rd, 11:00AM, 11 days before the demo.

36
00:02:31.325 --> 00:02:36.650
After researching through the numerous emails
from Donald related to Project Mercury,

37
00:02:36.875 --> 00:02:38.850
Bob locates the instructions

38
00:02:38.850 --> 00:02:44.050
to migrate some template Python scripts
from a Windows environment to Linux.

39
00:02:44.775 --> 00:02:48.175
He would have to set up
a Django project on Linux,

40
00:02:48.400 --> 00:02:53.350
which required him to copy several files
remotely and uncompress them.

41
00:02:54.225 --> 00:02:58.375
He would also need to make modifications
to the configuration files

42
00:02:58.700 --> 00:03:00.550
and update some parts of the code.

43
00:03:01.175 --> 00:03:04.225
He decides to make use of
the quick-start guide again

44
00:03:04.625 --> 00:03:06.575
to learn the commands for archiving,

45
00:03:06.900 --> 00:03:10.375
extracting data and working
with text editors.
