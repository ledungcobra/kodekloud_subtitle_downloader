00:00:01.070 --> 00:00:08.650
July 8, 1:00 PM, six days before the demo,
Bob is ecstatic.

2
00:00:09.020 --> 00:00:13.100
He has been able to get the sample
project working on his laptop.

3
00:00:13.520 --> 00:00:16.100
Finally, he has some time to spare

4
00:00:16.250 --> 00:00:20.170
and decides to check the company's
internal software repository.

5
00:00:21.000 --> 00:00:23.170
He had got the URL from Dave

6
00:00:23.470 --> 00:00:27.500
and remembers him saying that
it is accessible from the office network.

7
00:00:28.000 --> 00:00:31.370
He opens his web browser
and types in the URL,

8
00:00:31.370 --> 00:00:36.920
http://caleston-repos.

9
00:00:37.900 --> 00:00:40.850
However, he runs into an unexpected error.

10
00:00:41.420 --> 00:00:43.820
He is not sure why he got this error

11
00:00:44.070 --> 00:00:46.850
and tries to reach out to Dave
on the communicator.

12
00:00:47.620 --> 00:00:50.570
"Ah, Dave is away on his vacation,"

13
00:00:51.220 --> 00:00:52.750
Bob thinks to himself!"

14
00:00:53.500 --> 00:00:55.920
This appears to be an issue with the network.

15
00:00:56.500 --> 00:00:59.270
I better open up a ticket
with the network team."

16
00:00:59.850 --> 00:01:02.120
He creates a ticket in ServiceNow.

17
00:01:02.670 --> 00:01:04.100
After a couple of hours,

18
00:01:04.270 --> 00:01:06.850
he gets a message on Skype from Jacqui.

19
00:01:07.500 --> 00:01:11.050
"Hey, Bob. My name is Jacqui
and I am from the network team.

20
00:01:11.400 --> 00:01:16.650
I got your ticket and was wondering if you
have some time to troubleshoot," says Jacqui.

21
00:01:17.820 --> 00:01:20.320
"Hey, Jacqui, thank you very much.

22
00:01:20.600 --> 00:01:22.870
Yes, indeed. I do have some time now."

23
00:01:23.600 --> 00:01:25.100
"Great, thanks.

24
00:01:25.420 --> 00:01:27.870
Can you come find me at the IT support floor?

25
00:01:28.170 --> 00:01:30.570
Desk 8A-052.

26
00:01:31.200 --> 00:01:34.820
I think it's better to do this in person,"
says Jacqui.

27
00:01:35.720 --> 00:01:37.550
"Sure, see you soon."

28
00:01:38.470 --> 00:01:42.620
Bob meets Jacqui at her desk and
gives an overview of the problem.

29
00:01:43.300 --> 00:01:46.750
"So, I'm trying to connect to the repo server
from the browser

30
00:01:46.750 --> 00:01:48.100
and I'm getting this error.

31
00:01:48.400 --> 00:01:50.400
I'm not sure why it's not working.

32
00:01:50.820 --> 00:01:54.620
It sure was working on Dave's laptop," says Bob.

33
00:01:56.200 --> 00:01:58.870
Jacqui inspects the error and asks,

34
00:01:59.170 --> 00:02:01.470
"Are you sure that's the correct URL?

35
00:02:01.750 --> 00:02:06.070
Just by looking at the error,
I can tell that it's not a valid DNS name.

36
00:02:06.650 --> 00:02:10.970
Are you sure that Dave was not using
a file-based name resolution for this site?"

37
00:02:12.170 --> 00:02:14.250
Bob was not sure what that meant.

38
00:02:15.520 --> 00:02:18.420
"That's all right. Let's try to
get to the bottom of this.

39
00:02:19.050 --> 00:02:21.000
Let me try this on my laptop."

40
00:02:22.070 --> 00:02:25.920
She tries to open the same URL
and gets the same error.

41
00:02:27.500 --> 00:02:32.320
"See, the issue is with the URL.
I don't think that's a valid name.

42
00:02:32.770 --> 00:02:35.950
If I remember correctly, the address should be

43
00:02:36.150 --> 00:02:42.370
http://caleston-repos-01."

44
00:02:43.670 --> 00:02:46.320
She tries it and gets a different error now.

45
00:02:48.300 --> 00:02:51.820
"That seems to be the correct URL,
but it's still not working.

46
00:02:52.750 --> 00:02:55.820
The error with respect to DNS is gone now,

47
00:02:56.100 --> 00:02:59.550
but it's still not working," says Jacqui.

48
00:03:00.350 --> 00:03:04.950
"If you don't mind, can you explain how to
go about troubleshooting these issues?"

49
00:03:05.500 --> 00:03:06.850
asks Bob,

50
00:03:07.270 --> 00:03:10.100
"I am quite new to Linux and networking.

51
00:03:10.220 --> 00:03:12.550
I would appreciate any tips you can give me.

52
00:03:13.500 --> 00:03:16.000
I have this client demonstration next week

53
00:03:16.000 --> 00:03:19.350
and want to make sure it goes
well without any hiccups."

54
00:03:19.870 --> 00:03:22.150
Jacqui smiles, "Sure thing.

55
00:03:22.550 --> 00:03:24.170
Do you have a few minutes to spare?

56
00:03:25.070 --> 00:03:29.050
If you have some time now, I can walk
you through some of the networking basics,

57
00:03:29.350 --> 00:03:32.070
and then we can troubleshoot
this problem from the ground up.

58
00:03:32.670 --> 00:03:34.320
Does that sound good to you?"

59
00:03:34.970 --> 00:03:39.850
"Sounds perfect. Thank you very much,"
Bob exclaims.

60
00:03:40.700 --> 00:03:44.570
"Let's start from the beginning," says Jacqui.

61
00:03:45.700 --> 00:03:48.370
"So, you were trying to access the site,

62
00:03:48.370 --> 00:03:53.070
http://caleston-repos.

63
00:03:53.450 --> 00:03:58.700
While doing this, you got an error
'DNS PROBE FINISHED NX DOMAIN.'

64
00:03:59.800 --> 00:04:04.550
Well, this means that the client,
which in this case is your laptop,

65
00:04:04.770 --> 00:04:08.700
is not able to locate the IP address
of caleston-repos.

66
00:04:09.450 --> 00:04:13.920
To understand this a bit better,
let me explain a bit about DNS."
