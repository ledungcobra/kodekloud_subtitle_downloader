00:00:00.460 --> 00:00:02.410
Jacqui continues with the session.

2
00:00:02.960 --> 00:00:05.680
Now, let us look at some networking basics

3
00:00:05.680 --> 00:00:07.310
such as switching and routing.

4
00:00:07.750 --> 00:00:08.810
In this section,

5
00:00:08.810 --> 00:00:11.660
we will focus
on general networking concepts

6
00:00:11.660 --> 00:00:13.580
such as network interfaces,

7
00:00:13.580 --> 00:00:15.050
gateways, and routes.

8
00:00:15.500 --> 00:00:17.140
We have two computers,

9
00:00:17.180 --> 00:00:18.220
A and B,

10
00:00:18.520 --> 00:00:20.480
laptops, desktops,

11
00:00:20.480 --> 00:00:22.580
VMs on the cloud, wherever.

12
00:00:23.020 --> 00:00:25.110
How does system A reach B?

13
00:00:25.480 --> 00:00:27.360
We connect them to a switch

14
00:00:27.360 --> 00:00:29.260
and the switch creates a network

15
00:00:29.260 --> 00:00:30.810
containing the two systems.

16
00:00:31.400 --> 00:00:32.960
To connect them to a switch,

17
00:00:32.960 --> 00:00:35.380
we need an interface on each host,

18
00:00:35.720 --> 00:00:38.250
physical or virtual, depending on the host.

19
00:00:38.920 --> 00:00:41.180
To see the interfaces for the host,

20
00:00:41.180 --> 00:00:43.510
we use the IP link command.

21
00:00:43.740 --> 00:00:44.840
In this case,

22
00:00:44.840 --> 00:00:47.240
we look at the interface named eth0

23
00:00:47.240 --> 00:00:49.850
that we will be using to connect to the switch.

24
00:00:50.520 --> 00:00:53.050
Let's assume it's a network with the address

25
00:00:53.050 --> 00:00:57.080
192.168.1.0,

26
00:00:57.560 --> 00:01:01.610
we then assign the systems
with IP addresses on the same network.

27
00:01:02.140 --> 00:01:06.120
For this, we use the command ip addr.

28
00:01:06.740 --> 00:01:08.180
Once the links are up

29
00:01:08.180 --> 00:01:10.200
and the IP addresses are assigned,

30
00:01:10.440 --> 00:01:13.850
the computers can now communicate
with each other through the switch.

31
00:01:14.360 --> 00:01:17.650
The switch can only enable communication
within a network.

32
00:01:18.040 --> 00:01:21.880
This means it can receive packets
from a host on the network

33
00:01:21.880 --> 00:01:25.150
and deliver it to other systems
within the same network.

34
00:01:27.240 --> 00:01:31.300
Say we have another network
containing systems C and D

35
00:01:31.300 --> 00:01:35.810
at address 192.168.2.0,

36
00:01:36.580 --> 00:01:42.900
the systems have IP address 192.168.2.10

37
00:01:42.900 --> 00:01:45.210
and 2.11 respectively.

38
00:01:46.100 --> 00:01:48.280
How does the system in one network

39
00:01:48.280 --> 00:01:49.710
reach a system in the other?

40
00:01:50.210 --> 00:01:51.840
How does system B

41
00:01:51.840 --> 00:01:54.160
with the IP 1.11

42
00:01:54.160 --> 00:01:55.910
reach system C

43
00:01:55.910 --> 00:01:58.240
with the IP 2.10

44
00:01:58.240 --> 00:01:59.450
on the other network?

45
00:02:00.450 --> 00:02:02.380
That's where a router comes in.

46
00:02:02.780 --> 00:02:05.780
A router helps
connect two networks together.

47
00:02:06.020 --> 00:02:07.920
It is an intelligent device.

48
00:02:07.920 --> 00:02:11.410
Think of it as another server
with many network ports.

49
00:02:11.950 --> 00:02:14.680
Since it connects
to the two separate networks,

50
00:02:14.680 --> 00:02:16.700
it gets two IPs assigned,

51
00:02:17.140 --> 00:02:18.610
one on each network.

52
00:02:19.000 --> 00:02:20.450
In the first network,

53
00:02:20.450 --> 00:02:23.680
we assign it an IP address 1.1

54
00:02:24.000 --> 00:02:25.310
and in the second one,

55
00:02:25.310 --> 00:02:28.180
we assign it an IP address 2.1.

56
00:02:28.740 --> 00:02:31.960
Now we have a router
connected to the two networks

57
00:02:31.960 --> 00:02:34.410
that can enable communication between them.

58
00:02:35.980 --> 00:02:39.650
When system B tries
to send a packet to system C,

59
00:02:40.000 --> 00:02:44.280
how does it know where the router is
on the network to send the packet through?

60
00:02:44.740 --> 00:02:47.660
The router is just another device
on the network.

61
00:02:47.860 --> 00:02:50.480
There could be many other such devices.

62
00:02:52.320 --> 00:02:56.080
That's where we configure the systems
with a gateway or a route.

63
00:02:56.420 --> 00:02:58.280
If the network was a room,

64
00:02:58.280 --> 00:03:00.880
the gateway is a door to the outside world,

65
00:03:00.880 --> 00:03:03.050
to other networks or to the internet.

66
00:03:03.920 --> 00:03:07.810
The systems need to know
where the door is to go through that.

67
00:03:08.280 --> 00:03:11.550
To see the existing routing configuration
on a system,

68
00:03:11.550 --> 00:03:13.280
run the route command.

69
00:03:13.560 --> 00:03:15.760
It displays the kernel's routing table.

70
00:03:16.000 --> 00:03:17.180
Within that,

71
00:03:17.180 --> 00:03:18.380
as you can see,

72
00:03:18.380 --> 00:03:21.510
there are no routing configurations
as of now.

73
00:03:21.920 --> 00:03:23.200
In this condition,

74
00:03:23.200 --> 00:03:26.650
your system B
will not be able to reach system C.

75
00:03:27.020 --> 00:03:30.200
It can only reach other systems
within the same network

76
00:03:30.200 --> 00:03:34.680
in the range 192.168.1.0.

77
00:03:35.780 --> 00:03:36.780
In Linux,

78
00:03:36.780 --> 00:03:39.340
to configure a gateway on system B

79
00:03:39.340 --> 00:03:42.310
to reach the systems on network 2.0,

80
00:03:42.580 --> 00:03:45.350
run the ip route add command

81
00:03:45.640 --> 00:03:49.080
and specify that you can reach the 2.0 network

82
00:03:49.260 --> 00:03:51.000
through the door or gateway

83
00:03:51.000 --> 00:03:52.550
at 1.1.

84
00:03:53.410 --> 00:03:55.120
Rerunning the route command

85
00:03:55.120 --> 00:04:00.650
shows that we have a route added to reach
the 2.0 series network through the router.

86
00:04:02.480 --> 00:04:03.560
Now remember,

87
00:04:03.560 --> 00:04:06.250
this has to be configured on all systems.

88
00:04:06.560 --> 00:04:11.210
For example, if the system C
is to send a packet to system B,

89
00:04:11.500 --> 00:04:14.880
then you need to add a route
on system C's routing table

90
00:04:14.880 --> 00:04:17.280
to access network 1.0

91
00:04:17.520 --> 00:04:21.510
through the router
configured with the IP address 2.1.

92
00:04:23.310 --> 00:04:26.640
Suppose these systems
need access to the internet,

93
00:04:27.240 --> 00:04:35.210
say they need access to Google
at 172.217.194.0 network on the internet,

94
00:04:35.210 --> 00:04:37.450
you connect the router to the internet.

95
00:04:38.110 --> 00:04:41.180
Then add a new route in your routing table

96
00:04:41.180 --> 00:04:48.250
to route all traffic
to the network 172.217.194 through your router.

97
00:04:49.100 --> 00:04:53.080
There are so many different sites
on different networks on the internet.

98
00:04:53.340 --> 00:04:55.640
Instead of adding a routing table entry

99
00:04:55.640 --> 00:04:59.600
with the same routers IP address
for each of those networks,

100
00:04:59.600 --> 00:05:03.700
you can simply say, for any network
that you don't know a route to,

101
00:05:03.700 --> 00:05:06.450
use this router as the default gateway.

102
00:05:06.810 --> 00:05:11.380
This way, any request to any network
outside of your existing network

103
00:05:11.380 --> 00:05:13.350
goes to this particular router.

104
00:05:13.840 --> 00:05:16.150
In a simple setup like this,

105
00:05:16.150 --> 00:05:19.040
all you need is a single routing table entry

106
00:05:19.040 --> 00:05:22.450
with the default gateway
set to the routers IP address.

107
00:05:22.940 --> 00:05:25.640
Remember, instead of the word default,

108
00:05:25.640 --> 00:05:30.180
you could also say 0.0.0.0,

109
00:05:30.480 --> 00:05:33.180
it means any IP destination.

110
00:05:33.580 --> 00:05:36.010
Both of these lines mean the same thing.

111
00:05:36.510 --> 00:05:41.400
A 0.0.0.0 entry in the gateway field

112
00:05:41.400 --> 00:05:43.680
indicates that you don't need a gateway.

113
00:05:44.200 --> 00:05:46.080
For example, in this case,

114
00:05:46.080 --> 00:05:50.580
for system C to access any device
in the 2.0 network,

115
00:05:50.580 --> 00:05:52.520
it doesn't need a gateway

116
00:05:52.520 --> 00:05:54.450
because it is its own network,

117
00:05:56.280 --> 00:05:59.440
but say you have multiple routers
in your network,

118
00:05:59.440 --> 00:06:00.760
one for the intranet

119
00:06:00.760 --> 00:06:03.260
and another for internal private networks,

120
00:06:03.510 --> 00:06:06.980
then you will need to have
two separate entries for each network.

121
00:06:07.340 --> 00:06:10.000
One entry for the internal private network

122
00:06:10.000 --> 00:06:13.050
and another default gateway
for all other networks,

123
00:06:13.050 --> 00:06:14.740
including public networks.

124
00:06:15.180 --> 00:06:18.810
If you are having issues
reaching the internet from your systems,

125
00:06:18.810 --> 00:06:20.180
this routing table,

126
00:06:20.180 --> 00:06:22.420
and the default gateway configuration

127
00:06:22.420 --> 00:06:24.050
is a good place to look at.

128
00:06:25.940 --> 00:06:29.180
Let's take away some key commands
from this session.

129
00:06:29.480 --> 00:06:32.180
These will be handy
in our troubleshooting session.

130
00:06:32.520 --> 00:06:33.760
IP link

131
00:06:33.760 --> 00:06:36.880
is to list and modify interfaces on the host,

132
00:06:37.340 --> 00:06:39.540
ip addr command

133
00:06:39.540 --> 00:06:43.210
is to see the IP addresses
assigned to those interfaces.

134
00:06:43.920 --> 00:06:46.510
ip addr add command

135
00:06:46.510 --> 00:06:49.880
is used to set IP addresses on the interfaces.

136
00:06:50.060 --> 00:06:51.150
Now remember,

137
00:06:51.150 --> 00:06:55.660
changes made using these commands
are only valid till a system restart.

138
00:06:55.960 --> 00:06:58.520
If you want to persist these changes,

139
00:06:58.520 --> 00:07:04.280
you must set them
in the /etc/network/interfaces file.

140
00:07:05.580 --> 00:07:06.940
IP route

141
00:07:06.940 --> 00:07:08.680
or simply the route command

142
00:07:08.680 --> 00:07:10.810
is used to view the routing table

143
00:07:11.260 --> 00:07:13.350
and ip route add command

144
00:07:13.350 --> 00:07:16.110
is used to add entries into the routing table.
