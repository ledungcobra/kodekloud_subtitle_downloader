00:00:00.875 --> 00:00:05.475
July 12th, 7:00 PM, two days before the demo.

2
00:00:06.350 --> 00:00:09.350
Bob is working overtime on a Friday evening.

3
00:00:09.800 --> 00:00:12.650
He is sitting in the lounge area
instead of his desk.

4
00:00:13.325 --> 00:00:14.650
Dave is sitting beside him.

5
00:00:15.425 --> 00:00:18.975
He had to complete an urgent
change request in production

6
00:00:19.150 --> 00:00:21.900
that required patching hundreds of servers.

7
00:00:22.825 --> 00:00:28.725
Bob is making sure that his Django
application works properly before switching over to the Dev Servers.

8
00:00:29.900 --> 00:00:31.475
He has a new problem.

9
00:00:31.800 --> 00:00:37.100
Every time he exits the terminal or reboots
the system, his application stops.

10
00:00:38.250 --> 00:00:42.300
"Now, how do I make it run in the
background and ensure that it is up

11
00:00:42.300 --> 00:00:46.625
and running when the system boots?"
asks Bob to Dave.

12
00:00:47.525 --> 00:00:51.775
"You need to create a SYSTEMD
service for the application.

13
00:00:52.775 --> 00:00:56.850
Tell you what. I should be done
in another 15 minutes

14
00:00:57.150 --> 00:01:00.150
and then I can show you how it's done,"
says Dave.

15
00:01:00.875 --> 00:01:02.850
"Thanks," says Bob,

16
00:01:03.650 --> 00:01:06.575
"But didn't you have over 100 servers to patch?

17
00:01:07.075 --> 00:01:08.950
How are you doing this so quickly?"

18
00:01:09.800 --> 00:01:11.125
Dave smiles.

19
00:01:11.375 --> 00:01:16.275
"Ah, I am using an automation tool
called ANSIBLE.

20
00:01:16.700 --> 00:01:20.375
I will show you how that works
someday but for now,

21
00:01:21.050 --> 00:01:24.200
let me show you service management
with SYSTEMD."
