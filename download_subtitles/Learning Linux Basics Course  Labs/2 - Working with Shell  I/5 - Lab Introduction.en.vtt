00:00:01.021 --> 00:00:02.850
-This is an introductory video

2
00:00:02.850 --> 00:00:06.793
to give you a quick tour of the hands-on labs
available in this course.

3
00:00:07.017 --> 00:00:10.189
If you have never used
the code cloud labs before,

4
00:00:10.317 --> 00:00:12.914
please watch this
before attempting the labs.

5
00:00:13.805 --> 00:00:18.006
The hands-on labs will require you
to type in commands in the Linux shell

6
00:00:18.025 --> 00:00:18.882
using a keyboard.

7
00:00:19.451 --> 00:00:23.003
Hence, you will need a laptop
or a desktop to use the labs.

8
00:00:24.057 --> 00:00:26.777
Now let us get introduced to the labs.

9
00:00:27.136 --> 00:00:30.260
Each lab is specially designed
to help you practice

10
00:00:30.477 --> 00:00:34.555
and gain more knowledge on the topics
learned in the previous lecture videos.

11
00:00:35.122 --> 00:00:39.782
Click on the link to open the hands-on lab
and wait for the lab environment to load.

12
00:00:40.297 --> 00:00:41.860
This can take a few minutes.

13
00:00:42.656 --> 00:00:43.977
Once the lab is loaded,

14
00:00:44.217 --> 00:00:47.716
you will be taken to a real Linux command-line
interface.

15
00:00:48.093 --> 00:00:52.713
This environment will provide you with
the experience of working on Bob's laptop.

16
00:00:53.264 --> 00:00:55.526
The lab interface has two sections.

17
00:00:56.150 --> 00:00:58.612
The Linux terminal is on the left-hand side.

18
00:00:59.024 --> 00:01:01.113
This is where you will be
running the commands

19
00:01:01.113 --> 00:01:04.557
and carrying out tasks
based on the questions asked.

20
00:01:05.046 --> 00:01:07.446
The questions can be found in the lab portal

21
00:01:07.725 --> 00:01:10.084
which is on the right-hand side
of the split-screen.

22
00:01:10.770 --> 00:01:13.545
There are two types of questions
that you can expect.

23
00:01:13.899 --> 00:01:15.533
The multiple-choice questions,

24
00:01:15.664 --> 00:01:18.822
where you will have to look up
the answer for a specific question

25
00:01:18.864 --> 00:01:20.925
by typing in commands on the terminal.

26
00:01:21.586 --> 00:01:22.646
Once you know the answer,

27
00:01:22.973 --> 00:01:26.541
click on the appropriate answer button
to move on to the next question.

28
00:01:27.522 --> 00:01:28.224
For example,

29
00:01:28.363 --> 00:01:32.434
in this question, we have to find the path
to Bob's home directory.

30
00:01:32.870 --> 00:01:36.477
Let us find that out by running
the "echo dollar home" command.

31
00:01:37.110 --> 00:01:41.056
This shows that the home directory
is /home/Bob.

32
00:01:41.467 --> 00:01:43.296
Let's select that as our answer.

33
00:01:44.516 --> 00:01:46.148
Once the answer has been validated,

34
00:01:46.441 --> 00:01:48.242
it will take you to the next question.

35
00:01:49.017 --> 00:01:52.219
The second type of question
is the configuration test.

36
00:01:52.603 --> 00:01:56.587
This is where you will be asked
to complete a specific task on the terminal.

37
00:01:57.504 --> 00:01:58.342
For example,

38
00:01:58.470 --> 00:02:02.336
in this case we have
to create a directory called "Birds"

39
00:02:02.336 --> 00:02:03.723
in Bob's home directory.

40
00:02:04.564 --> 00:02:05.323
To do this,

41
00:02:05.492 --> 00:02:12.889
let's type in the command "mkdir/home/Bob/birds"
in the terminal.

42
00:02:13.846 --> 00:02:15.581
Clicking on the Check button

43
00:02:15.700 --> 00:02:18.425
will validate if the task
has been completed correctly.

44
00:02:19.412 --> 00:02:21.131
It looks like we made a mistake.

45
00:02:21.412 --> 00:02:22.697
To see what went wrong,

46
00:02:22.800 --> 00:02:25.590
click on this icon here to get more details.

47
00:02:26.525 --> 00:02:28.281
Our directory name is wrong.

48
00:02:28.601 --> 00:02:32.784
We created the directory called "Bird"
not "Birds."

49
00:02:33.270 --> 00:02:35.437
That's all right, let's correct that.

50
00:02:36.290 --> 00:02:40.208
Now, when we click the Check button,
the task has been validated

51
00:02:41.200 --> 00:02:42.600
and we can move on to the next question.

52
00:02:43.318 --> 00:02:43.906
Finally,

53
00:02:44.006 --> 00:02:46.265
if you are not sure how to attempt to question,

54
00:02:46.624 --> 00:02:47.437
don't worry.

55
00:02:47.691 --> 00:02:49.204
Click on the Hint button

56
00:02:49.344 --> 00:02:52.793
and you will be presented with a hint
that will help you answer the question.

57
00:02:57.819 --> 00:02:58.461
Good luck.
