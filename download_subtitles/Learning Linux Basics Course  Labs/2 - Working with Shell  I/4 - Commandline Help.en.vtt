00:00:00.740 --> 00:00:01.680
-In this lesson,

2
00:00:01.980 --> 00:00:03.560
we will see the different ways

3
00:00:03.600 --> 00:00:05.420
to get help while using the shell.

4
00:00:08.600 --> 00:00:10.560
If you are new to using Linux

5
00:00:10.660 --> 00:00:11.940
and the bash shell

6
00:00:12.400 --> 00:00:15.320
or if you are not sure which command does what,

7
00:00:15.780 --> 00:00:18.220
there are a few commands within bash

8
00:00:18.400 --> 00:00:19.640
that can help get started.

9
00:00:20.780 --> 00:00:23.420
The first command is called "whatis."

10
00:00:24.060 --> 00:00:24.900
This command

11
00:00:25.140 --> 00:00:27.260
displays a one-line description

12
00:00:27.360 --> 00:00:28.880
of what a command does.

13
00:00:29.600 --> 00:00:30.740
This is quite handy

14
00:00:30.780 --> 00:00:32.840
if you're not sure what a command does

15
00:00:32.880 --> 00:00:33.840
before using it.

16
00:00:34.880 --> 00:00:37.800
Most of the commands, internal or external,

17
00:00:38.220 --> 00:00:40.120
come bundled with man pages.

18
00:00:40.860 --> 00:00:42.480
These provide information

19
00:00:42.540 --> 00:00:44.280
about the command in detail,

20
00:00:44.540 --> 00:00:45.980
often with examples,

21
00:00:46.160 --> 00:00:48.580
use cases, as well as information

22
00:00:48.620 --> 00:00:50.100
about the command options.

23
00:00:51.040 --> 00:00:56.060
Several commands provide a "-h" or a -help option

24
00:00:56.280 --> 00:00:58.440
to provide users with the options

25
00:00:58.640 --> 00:01:00.840
and use cases available in a command.

26
00:01:01.900 --> 00:01:03.700
These can also be displayed

27
00:01:03.740 --> 00:01:05.660
if a command is used incorrectly.

28
00:01:06.800 --> 00:01:09.580
The last command on our list is "apropos."

29
00:01:10.300 --> 00:01:11.900
This handy little command

30
00:01:11.960 --> 00:01:14.120
will search through the man page names

31
00:01:14.320 --> 00:01:17.000
and descriptions for instances of a keyword.

32
00:01:17.920 --> 00:01:18.820
This is useful

33
00:01:18.860 --> 00:01:20.840
if you want to look up all commands

34
00:01:20.880 --> 00:01:22.500
within the system that contains

35
00:01:22.540 --> 00:01:23.820
a specific keyword.

36
00:01:24.880 --> 00:01:25.760
For example,

37
00:01:26.080 --> 00:01:30.400
let's look up the keyword M-O-D-P-R using apropos.

38
00:01:31.400 --> 00:01:34.120
The result prints two possible options,

39
00:01:34.420 --> 00:01:38.560
the command modprobe, and modprobe.d,

40
00:01:39.000 --> 00:01:40.780
which is the config directory

41
00:01:40.880 --> 00:01:42.600
for the modprobe command.

42
00:01:43.740 --> 00:01:47.460
"That was a useful lesson," Bob thinks.

43
00:01:47.880 --> 00:01:49.560
"Another one to try out later."

44
00:01:52.820 --> 00:01:56.260
Now, let's test the lessons learned so far

45
00:01:56.420 --> 00:01:58.660
with a hands on lab exercise.
