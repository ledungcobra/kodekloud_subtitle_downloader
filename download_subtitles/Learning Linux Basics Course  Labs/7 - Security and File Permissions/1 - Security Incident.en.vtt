00:00:00.950 --> 00:00:05.700
July 5th, 11:00 AM, nine days before the demo.

2
00:00:06.700 --> 00:00:12.200
Bob gets an invite to join a high-priority
conference call from someone called Vikram.

3
00:00:12.950 --> 00:00:18.050
A quick check in the office directory shows
that Vikram is a security analyst.

4
00:00:19.150 --> 00:00:20.700
â€œThat's quite unexpected.

5
00:00:21.025 --> 00:00:26.175
Why would someone from the security
want to talk to me?" wonders, Bob.

6
00:00:27.325 --> 00:00:31.400
Vikram tells Bob that the routine
system scan has reported

7
00:00:31.400 --> 00:00:36.700
that Bob has placed some client confidential
information in the file share,

8
00:00:37.050 --> 00:00:39.875
which is accessible by everyone
at the organization.

9
00:00:40.925 --> 00:00:44.175
This incident has been escalated
to Andrew as well.

10
00:00:44.825 --> 00:00:47.275
He urges Bob to fix it at once.

11
00:00:48.075 --> 00:00:49.450
Bob panics.

12
00:00:49.650 --> 00:00:52.875
Luckily, Dave is around and
sorts it out immediately.

13
00:00:53.650 --> 00:00:57.475
"There you go. No harm done," says Dave.

14
00:00:58.250 --> 00:01:02.325
"Thanks, Dave. This is so
not what I needed right now.

15
00:01:02.625 --> 00:01:07.075
Andrew is not happy with me
as it is," says Bob in despair.

16
00:01:07.675 --> 00:01:10.025
"What's wrong?" asks Dave.

17
00:01:10.750 --> 00:01:13.450
"I've been working on tasks from Donald

18
00:01:13.700 --> 00:01:17.550
and I'm lagging behind on Project Mercury,"
Bob responds.

19
00:01:18.375 --> 00:01:23.550
"Remember the advice that I gave you last time?"
replies Dave.

20
00:01:24.375 --> 00:01:25.475
Bob nods.

21
00:01:25.875 --> 00:01:30.975
"Right, I have been concentrating on
Project Mercury for the past few days now

22
00:01:31.200 --> 00:01:32.600
and now this happens."

23
00:01:33.400 --> 00:01:36.150
"Anyway, if you have some time,

24
00:01:36.150 --> 00:01:39.550
I can show you how you could
have avoided this situation.

25
00:01:39.875 --> 00:01:42.050
We can continue with our training

26
00:01:42.500 --> 00:01:46.900
and I can show you some of
the basics of account management

27
00:01:46.900 --> 00:01:50.750
and file permissions Linux," Dave offers.

28
00:01:51.250 --> 00:01:56.250
"Okay, let's do that now.
Thanks, Dave," says Bob.
