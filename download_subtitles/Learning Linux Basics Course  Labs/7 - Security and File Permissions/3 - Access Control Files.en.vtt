1
00:00:02.480 --> 00:00:05.600
Let us now look
at access control files.

2
00:00:05.600 --> 00:00:08.909
Most of the access
control files in Linux

3
00:00:08.993 --> 00:00:11.980
are stored under the /etc directory.

4
00:00:11.980 --> 00:00:14.817
This directory can be read
by any user by default,

5
00:00:14.901 --> 00:00:18.490
but only the root user
has access to write to it.

6
00:00:19.920 --> 00:00:22.264
The access control
files are also designed

7
00:00:22.348 --> 00:00:24.830
in a way that they
should never be modified

8
00:00:24.830 --> 00:00:26.890
using a text editor.

9
00:00:26.890 --> 00:00:33.200
Instead, use the built-in commands
to add or modify access as needed.

10
00:00:33.200 --> 00:00:36.220
We will see how to do that
in the next lecture.

11
00:00:36.220 --> 00:00:41.120
For now, let us look at the basic
access control files in Linux.

12
00:00:41.120 --> 00:00:44.857
The first one of interest
is the /etc/passwd file,

13
00:00:44.941 --> 00:00:48.099
which is also commonly known as just

14
00:00:48.199 --> 00:00:50.320
the password file.

15
00:00:50.320 --> 00:00:52.932
We have already seen
that this file contains

16
00:00:53.016 --> 00:00:55.890
basic information about
the users in the system

17
00:00:55.890 --> 00:00:59.488
including the username,
UID, GID,

18
00:00:59.572 --> 00:01:02.969
home directory,
their default shell.

19
00:01:02.969 --> 00:01:08.300
It is important to note that this
file does not save any passwords.

20
00:01:08.300 --> 00:01:11.610
The passwords are stored
in another file located

21
00:01:11.633 --> 00:01:13.833
at /etc/shadow.

22
00:01:13.910 --> 00:01:17.550
The contents of this file are hashed.

23
00:01:17.550 --> 00:01:21.699
The /etc/group file
stores information

24
00:01:21.883 --> 00:01:24.970
about all user groups on the system,
such as

25
00:01:25.070 --> 00:01:29.850
the group name and GID and members.

26
00:01:31.150 --> 00:01:35.880
Let us now look at these access
control files in a bit more detail.

27
00:01:35.880 --> 00:01:38.681
In these files, each line represents

28
00:01:38.765 --> 00:01:42.690
information about
a particular user or a group.

29
00:01:42.690 --> 00:01:46.720
These lines have multiple fields
that are delimited by a colon.

30
00:01:46.720 --> 00:01:50.120
For the password file,
the fields separated

31
00:01:50.204 --> 00:01:54.890
are username, password,
UID, GID, gecos,

32
00:01:55.990 --> 00:02:00.180
the home directory of the user,
the shell.

33
00:02:00.180 --> 00:02:04.380
Username is self-explanatory
in a mandatory field.

34
00:02:04.380 --> 00:02:06.930
This is also the login name.

35
00:02:06.930 --> 00:02:13.860
The password field is X because it
is located in the /etc/shadow file.

36
00:02:14.560 --> 00:02:18.659
Next are the UID and GIDs
for the user.

37
00:02:18.659 --> 00:02:21.660
These two fields are
mandatory as well.

38
00:02:21.660 --> 00:02:25.496
Gecos is a CSV format
or a comma-separated

39
00:02:25.580 --> 00:02:29.590
list of user information
such as full name,

40
00:02:29.590 --> 00:02:32.799
location, phone number, et cetera.

41
00:02:32.799 --> 00:02:35.959
This is optional and can be blank.

42
00:02:35.959 --> 00:02:39.840
The home directory is the
path to the user's home directory.

43
00:02:39.840 --> 00:02:43.036
Finally, the last field
is the default shell

44
00:02:43.120 --> 00:02:46.180
for the user, which
in the case of Bob is

45
00:02:46.180 --> 00:02:48.040
the bash shell.

46
00:02:50.040 --> 00:02:54.920
Now, let us look at
the /etc/shadow file.

47
00:02:55.120 --> 00:02:58.610
The fields of the file
are separated by a colon.

48
00:02:58.610 --> 00:03:01.677
Reading from left to right,
the fields are username,

49
00:03:01.761 --> 00:03:03.669
which is the same as the one used

50
00:03:03.769 --> 00:03:06.700
in the password file,
password, which is

51
00:03:06.784 --> 00:03:10.090
the field containing
the encrypted password.

52
00:03:10.090 --> 00:03:12.853
An asterisk or empty field implies

53
00:03:12.937 --> 00:03:15.709
the password was
never set for this user.

54
00:03:15.709 --> 00:03:19.657
The next field is thelast changed,
which is the date

55
00:03:19.741 --> 00:03:22.649
since the password was last changed.

56
00:03:22.849 --> 00:03:25.799
This value is in epoch,
which is a Unix timestamp

57
00:03:25.883 --> 00:03:27.930
described as the number of days

58
00:03:27.930 --> 00:03:33.709
that have elapsed since midnight
January 1st, 1970.

59
00:03:33.709 --> 00:03:37.760
The next two fields are
the minimum and maximum age.

60
00:03:37.760 --> 00:03:40.079
These describe
the minimum number of days

61
00:03:40.163 --> 00:03:42.559
the user will have to wait
before being allowed

62
00:03:42.559 --> 00:03:45.345
to change the password
again and the maximum

63
00:03:45.429 --> 00:03:48.200
number of days before
which the user will

64
00:03:48.200 --> 00:03:50.889
have to change the password.

65
00:03:50.889 --> 00:03:53.551
The next field is the
number of days before

66
00:03:53.635 --> 00:03:56.379
a password is going
to expire that the user

67
00:03:56.379 --> 00:04:00.719
should be warned so that
they can change the password.

68
00:04:00.719 --> 00:04:03.559
The field inactive is
the number of days after

69
00:04:03.643 --> 00:04:06.379
a password has
expired that it should still

70
00:04:06.379 --> 00:04:09.480
be accepted before being disabled.

71
00:04:09.480 --> 00:04:14.099
This is empty in this example,
which means it is not enforced.

72
00:04:14.099 --> 00:04:18.169
The last field is the expiry
date of the password.

73
00:04:18.169 --> 00:04:20.420
This is, again, in epoch and is
the date

74
00:04:20.504 --> 00:04:23.170
when the account will be expired.

75
00:04:23.170 --> 00:04:30.130
This field is empty, which implies
the account will never expire.

76
00:04:30.130 --> 00:04:33.062
The last access control file
we will take a look at

77
00:04:33.146 --> 00:04:37.140
is the /etc/group file.

78
00:04:37.340 --> 00:04:40.181
Just like the other
access control files,

79
00:04:40.265 --> 00:04:42.840
the fields are delimited by a colon.

80
00:04:42.840 --> 00:04:47.380
This file stores basic information
about the groups on the system.

81
00:04:47.380 --> 00:04:50.470
It is sometimes called
the group file.

82
00:04:50.470 --> 00:04:52.648
The first field is the
name of the group,

83
00:04:52.732 --> 00:04:55.900
followed by the password,
which is normally set to X,

84
00:04:55.900 --> 00:04:58.062
indicating that this is saved

85
00:04:58.146 --> 00:05:02.120
in the shadow file,
the same as the password file.

86
00:05:02.120 --> 00:05:04.760
Next, is the GID of the group.

87
00:05:04.760 --> 00:05:06.944
The last field contains
the members of

88
00:05:07.028 --> 00:05:09.410
the group, which can
be comma-separated.
