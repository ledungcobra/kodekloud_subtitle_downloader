00:00:02.120 --> 00:00:05.770
Now let us look at some of the
basic commands used to create

2
00:00:05.770 --> 00:00:08.100
and manage user accounts in Linux.

3
00:00:08.420 --> 00:00:12.420
The first command we will look at
is the useradd command.

4
00:00:12.970 --> 00:00:16.120
This is the command used by
the system administrators

5
00:00:16.450 --> 00:00:21.150
to create a new local user in the system,
such as the user for Bob.

6
00:00:21.750 --> 00:00:25.950
The simplest way to do this is
to use the command useradd,

7
00:00:26.200 --> 00:00:28.700
followed by the name of the user as an argument.

8
00:00:29.450 --> 00:00:33.200
In this case, a new user
called Bob has been created

9
00:00:33.200 --> 00:00:36.750
with a system-generated UID and GID.

10
00:00:37.550 --> 00:00:41.670
It will set the home directory for
Bob under the /home directory

11
00:00:42.020 --> 00:00:46.650
and default to /bin/sh as the default shell.

12
00:00:47.600 --> 00:00:51.770
To set the password for Bob,
use the passwd command,

13
00:00:52.250 --> 00:00:54.520
followed by the username, which is Bob.

14
00:00:55.250 --> 00:00:59.070
Please, note that both these commands,
useradd and passwd,

15
00:00:59.270 --> 00:01:00.820
need to be running as root.

16
00:01:01.820 --> 00:01:03.450
Once logged into the system,

17
00:01:03.750 --> 00:01:08.250
the user can check the user ID
by running the 'whoami' command.

18
00:01:08.820 --> 00:01:11.320
The user can change their own password

19
00:01:11.320 --> 00:01:14.900
from the shell by running the passwd
command without arguments.

20
00:01:17.850 --> 00:01:20.500
What we have seen so far in the example

21
00:01:20.500 --> 00:01:23.820
is using the useradd without any options.

22
00:01:24.450 --> 00:01:27.850
Here are some of the common options
used with this command,

23
00:01:28.320 --> 00:01:31.270
-c can be used for custom comments,

24
00:01:31.670 --> 00:01:35.020
-d to specify a home directory path,

25
00:01:35.720 --> 00:01:39.000
-e to specify the account expiration date,

26
00:01:39.500 --> 00:01:45.870
-u, and -g to specify custom UID
and GID respectively.

27
00:01:46.520 --> 00:01:52.850
The dash -G can be used to add the user
being created to multiple secondary groups.

28
00:01:53.570 --> 00:01:56.100
Here is an example where the user Bob

29
00:01:56.100 --> 00:01:59.370
is being created with some
of these additional options.

30
00:02:00.100 --> 00:02:02.020
Once the user has been created,

31
00:02:02.020 --> 00:02:04.650
we can validate that the custom fields

32
00:02:04.650 --> 00:02:09.020
were set by using the ID command
with the username as the argument.

33
00:02:09.750 --> 00:02:16.150
Here, we can see that Bob has
been created with the custom GID of 1009,

34
00:02:16.570 --> 00:02:20.320
which sets his primary group
to the group called Avenger.

35
00:02:20.920 --> 00:02:26.100
You can verify the custom comments have been
created by inspecting the password file

36
00:02:26.370 --> 00:02:28.850
and checking the fields for Bob's user account.

37
00:02:32.100 --> 00:02:35.450
Let us now look at user deletion
and managing groups.

38
00:02:36.520 --> 00:02:42.150
To delete a user account, run the userdel
command with the username.

39
00:02:42.970 --> 00:02:47.670
To add a new Linux group, we can
make use of the groupadd command

40
00:02:48.200 --> 00:02:52.770
with -g, we can specify a custom GID
for the group.

41
00:02:53.820 --> 00:02:59.220
Finally, use the groupdel command,
followed by the group name to remove it.

42
00:03:02.400 --> 00:03:05.120
Now head over to the hands-on labs,

43
00:03:05.320 --> 00:03:08.770
and practice working with user account
management in Linux.
