00:00:01.050 --> 00:00:05.100
"Now let's talk about the file system
hierarchy in Linux.

2
00:00:05.520 --> 00:00:10.770
I think that's one of the reasons
you wanted this session?" Dave asks.

3
00:00:11.300 --> 00:00:13.120
"Yes," says Bob.

4
00:00:14.170 --> 00:00:15.470
Dave carries on,

5
00:00:15.820 --> 00:00:19.500
"You already know that the
directory/home is the location

6
00:00:19.500 --> 00:00:24.020
that contains the home directories
for all users except for the root user.

7
00:00:24.770 --> 00:00:28.200
The root user's home directory
is located at /root.

8
00:00:29.020 --> 00:00:32.000
If you want to install
any third-party programs,

9
00:00:32.250 --> 00:00:35.020
put them in the /opt file system.

10
00:00:35.620 --> 00:00:39.600
For example, /opt would be the ideal location

11
00:00:39.600 --> 00:00:42.470
to install the web application
for Project Mercury."

12
00:00:44.470 --> 00:00:45.650
While they are at it,

13
00:00:45.950 --> 00:00:50.920
Dave recommends installing some security
mandated software on Bob's laptop.

14
00:00:51.550 --> 00:00:55.600
They were stored in a software repository
in the company's network share.

15
00:00:56.370 --> 00:01:03.520
He mounts this repository on a temporary
location called /mnt using the mount command.

16
00:01:04.470 --> 00:01:10.500
He copies the necessary packages from
this temporary mount to the /tmp location.

17
00:01:11.550 --> 00:01:14.700
He explains to Bob that the /mnt

18
00:01:14.700 --> 00:01:18.500
is used to mount file systems
temporarily in the system.

19
00:01:19.320 --> 00:01:23.800
The /tmp directory is used
to store temporary data.

20
00:01:24.600 --> 00:01:28.100
Once Dave installs the software from /tmp,

21
00:01:28.670 --> 00:01:31.870
he unmounts the network share from /mnt

22
00:01:32.220 --> 00:01:36.600
and deletes the files from /tmp as
they are no longer needed.

23
00:01:38.050 --> 00:01:43.450
Bob remembers that he has to copy some files
from a USB drive and plugs it in.

24
00:01:44.070 --> 00:01:48.670
He notices that the USB drive is
not in a location such as G drive

25
00:01:48.950 --> 00:01:50.520
as it would be in Windows.

26
00:01:51.020 --> 00:01:54.970
Instead, he sees that it is mounted under /media.

27
00:01:55.920 --> 00:02:01.600
Dave explains that all external media
is mounted under the /media file system

28
00:02:01.900 --> 00:02:04.670
and shows him a handy command called df.

29
00:02:05.670 --> 00:02:08.650
The df or the disk file system command

30
00:02:08.970 --> 00:02:12.420
prints out details about all
the mounted file systems.

31
00:02:13.300 --> 00:02:17.520
Here, he sees his USB disk
is mounted under /media.

32
00:02:18.270 --> 00:02:24.000
He also sees that it is
referencing a path /dev/sdb1.

33
00:02:24.920 --> 00:02:28.000
Dave explains that the /dev file system

34
00:02:28.320 --> 00:02:33.020
contains the special block and character
device files that were discussed earlier.

35
00:02:34.170 --> 00:02:37.400
This directory contains files
for devices such as

36
00:02:37.400 --> 00:02:41.870
external hard disks and devices
such as the mouse and keyboards.

37
00:02:42.450 --> 00:02:47.020
The basic programs and binaries
such as the cp, mv,

38
00:02:47.350 --> 00:02:52.750
mkdir, date commands are located
in the /bin directory.

39
00:02:53.550 --> 00:02:56.920
The /etc is a very important directory

40
00:02:56.920 --> 00:03:00.620
that is used to store most of
the configuration files in Linux.

41
00:03:01.450 --> 00:03:05.920
The directory/lib and /lib64 is the place

42
00:03:05.920 --> 00:03:09.520
to look for shared libraries to
be imported into your programs.

43
00:03:10.250 --> 00:03:15.870
In older systems, the /user directory
was used for user home directories.

44
00:03:16.170 --> 00:03:19.370
However, in the modern Linux operating systems,

45
00:03:19.700 --> 00:03:24.270
it is the location where all UserLAnd
applications and their data reside.

46
00:03:24.850 --> 00:03:28.820
Examples of these applications
are the Thunderbird mail client,

47
00:03:29.070 --> 00:03:33.270
Mozilla Firefox and VI Test Editor et cetera.

48
00:03:34.220 --> 00:03:38.700
Eventually, you are bound to run into issues
with the system or an application

49
00:03:39.120 --> 00:03:44.700
and when that happens, take a look at
the logs stored under the /var file system.

50
00:03:45.300 --> 00:03:50.650
This is the directory to which the system
writes data such as logs and cached data.

51
00:03:53.820 --> 00:03:55.250
Before we move on,

52
00:03:55.550 --> 00:03:59.870
let's try out the concepts learned in
this section with a hands-on lab.
