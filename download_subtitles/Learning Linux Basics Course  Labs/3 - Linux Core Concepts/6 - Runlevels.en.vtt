00:00:00.960 --> 00:00:03.240
Bob had noticed something unusual

2
00:00:03.320 --> 00:00:04.340
with Dave's laptop.

3
00:00:05.440 --> 00:00:08.740
"Dave, why is it that after the boot process

4
00:00:09.080 --> 00:00:10.700
your system goes directly

5
00:00:10.740 --> 00:00:13.900
to the command line interface?" he asks.

6
00:00:14.540 --> 00:00:15.840
"Mine always loads up

7
00:00:15.920 --> 00:00:17.380
the graphical interface."

8
00:00:18.480 --> 00:00:19.640
Dave replies,

9
00:00:19.960 --> 00:00:22.880
"Ah, that's because I have specifically

10
00:00:22.920 --> 00:00:24.140
set up my system

11
00:00:24.180 --> 00:00:26.300
to boot into a nongraphical view."

12
00:00:26.860 --> 00:00:28.340
Dave explains that

13
00:00:28.660 --> 00:00:30.880
Linux can run in multiple modes.

14
00:00:31.140 --> 00:00:32.500
You already know one of them,

15
00:00:32.940 --> 00:00:33.960
the graphical mode.

16
00:00:34.560 --> 00:00:36.040
Besides the graphical mode

17
00:00:36.160 --> 00:00:38.620
there are several other modes of operation.

18
00:00:39.140 --> 00:00:40.120
These modes are set

19
00:00:40.180 --> 00:00:41.840
by something called the run level.

20
00:00:42.720 --> 00:00:45.140
To see the operation mode set in the system

21
00:00:45.580 --> 00:00:47.660
run the command called runlevel

22
00:00:47.720 --> 00:00:48.460
from the shell

23
00:00:48.840 --> 00:00:50.660
and you should get a number like this.

24
00:00:52.360 --> 00:00:53.360
Dave's system

25
00:00:53.640 --> 00:00:55.760
the command returns a value of 3

26
00:00:56.160 --> 00:00:58.360
which means he is running runlevel 3.

27
00:00:59.080 --> 00:01:01.680
On Bob's laptop it is set to 5.

28
00:01:04.680 --> 00:01:05.860
The operation mode

29
00:01:05.940 --> 00:01:07.840
which provides a graphical interface

30
00:01:07.900 --> 00:01:09.660
is called the run level 5.

31
00:01:10.100 --> 00:01:13.060
The runlevel 3 implies a nongraphical mode.

32
00:01:14.280 --> 00:01:15.040
During boot

33
00:01:15.300 --> 00:01:17.380
the init process checks the run level.

34
00:01:17.880 --> 00:01:19.560
It makes sure that all programs

35
00:01:19.600 --> 00:01:21.300
needed to get the system operational

36
00:01:21.420 --> 00:01:22.660
in that mode are started.

37
00:01:23.340 --> 00:01:25.580
For example, the graphical user mode

38
00:01:25.660 --> 00:01:27.880
requires a display manager service

39
00:01:27.920 --> 00:01:29.760
to run for the GUI to work.

40
00:01:30.200 --> 00:01:32.460
However, this service is not required

41
00:01:32.540 --> 00:01:33.860
for the nongraphical mode.

42
00:01:36.980 --> 00:01:38.740
In the boot process section

43
00:01:39.060 --> 00:01:40.700
we saw that system D

44
00:01:40.800 --> 00:01:42.600
is used as the init process

45
00:01:42.640 --> 00:01:45.020
in most new Linux distributions

46
00:01:45.300 --> 00:01:47.720
such as Ubuntu 18.04.

47
00:01:48.560 --> 00:01:51.820
In system D runlevels are called targets.

48
00:01:52.740 --> 00:01:53.940
The runlevel 5

49
00:01:53.980 --> 00:01:55.740
is called the graphical target

50
00:01:56.020 --> 00:01:57.220
and runlevel 3

51
00:01:57.500 --> 00:01:59.660
is called the multi-user target.

52
00:02:00.280 --> 00:02:02.980
There are other run levels and targets in use

53
00:02:03.320 --> 00:02:04.440
but these are the two

54
00:02:04.480 --> 00:02:06.220
that are most commonly used.

55
00:02:06.820 --> 00:02:08.320
Check out the reference section

56
00:02:08.360 --> 00:02:09.560
for the complete list.

57
00:02:12.340 --> 00:02:14.320
Now that we are familiar with runlevels

58
00:02:14.440 --> 00:02:16.300
and system D target units,

59
00:02:16.700 --> 00:02:17.500
let's take a look

60
00:02:17.540 --> 00:02:19.300
at how we can change these values

61
00:02:19.340 --> 00:02:20.240
from the shell.

62
00:02:20.820 --> 00:02:22.420
To see the default target,

63
00:02:22.660 --> 00:02:26.740
run the command systemctl get-default.

64
00:02:27.620 --> 00:02:30.120
This command looks up the file located at

65
00:02:30.160 --> 00:02:36.840
/etc/systemd/system/default.target.

66
00:02:37.820 --> 00:02:38.660
In this case

67
00:02:38.900 --> 00:02:41.620
you can see that the default.target file

68
00:02:41.720 --> 00:02:44.160
is a symbolic link or a shortcut

69
00:02:44.220 --> 00:02:46.660
to the graphical.target unit file.

70
00:02:47.540 --> 00:02:49.160
This file is located under

71
00:02:49.200 --> 00:02:53.500
/lib/systemd/systemdirectory.

72
00:02:54.600 --> 00:02:56.240
To change the default target

73
00:02:56.540 --> 00:02:59.040
we can make use of the systemctl

74
00:02:59.080 --> 00:03:00.960
set-default command

75
00:03:01.340 --> 00:03:02.780
with the desired target

76
00:03:02.820 --> 00:03:04.140
as the command argument.

77
00:03:05.020 --> 00:03:07.540
Here we are changing the default target

78
00:03:07.600 --> 00:03:09.860
from graphical to multi-user.

79
00:03:10.520 --> 00:03:11.540
This is equivalent

80
00:03:11.600 --> 00:03:14.240
to switching the runlevel from 5 to 3.
