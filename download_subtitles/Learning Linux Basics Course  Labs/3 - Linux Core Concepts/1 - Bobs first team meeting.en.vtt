1
00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.080
Bob's first team meeting.

2
00:00:02.880 --> 00:00:04.420
"Good morning team.

3
00:00:04.420 --> 00:00:07.680
I would like you all to welcome
Bob to our team.

4
00:00:07.680 --> 00:00:10.600
He is our new developer
who will be assisting

5
00:00:10.600 --> 00:00:12.900
with the delivery of the Project Mercury."

6
00:00:13.500 --> 00:00:17.140
Bob receives a hearty welcome
from his new teammates.

7
00:00:17.140 --> 00:00:20.960
"I must say, Bob, good job on completing

8
00:00:20.960 --> 00:00:23.260
the mandatory training and the tests

9
00:00:23.260 --> 00:00:26.540
with such short notice," says Andrew.

10
00:00:27.400 --> 00:00:31.060
Andrew continues,
"Now, Bob, if you don't mind,

11
00:00:31.060 --> 00:00:33.400
can you introduce yourself to the team?"

12
00:00:33.960 --> 00:00:36.760
Bob smiles and introduces himself.

13
00:00:37.180 --> 00:00:40.420
"Excellent.
Now let me introduce the team

14
00:00:40.420 --> 00:00:42.920
that will deliver the Project Mercury.

15
00:00:43.480 --> 00:00:47.380
Donald here is a senior developer
who joined us last year,"

16
00:00:47.780 --> 00:00:51.340
says Andrew pointing to the man
sitting to his left.

17
00:00:51.820 --> 00:00:54.960
"He has helped us
with a couple of projects already

18
00:00:54.960 --> 00:00:59.100
and we'll work along with you
in the first phase of Project Mercury.

19
00:00:59.540 --> 00:01:04.360
Go to him for any technical advice
related to application development."

20
00:01:05.000 --> 00:01:08.580
"Amira," he points to the lady to his right,

21
00:01:08.580 --> 00:01:12.520
"will be the Project Manager
allocated to this engagement.

22
00:01:12.520 --> 00:01:16.740
You can expect a lot of emails
from her in the future."

23
00:01:17.420 --> 00:01:18.740
Andrew laughs.

24
00:01:19.220 --> 00:01:23.420
"And finally Aditi here is a Test Engineer

25
00:01:23.420 --> 00:01:24.340
we have in the team.

26
00:01:24.340 --> 00:01:28.860
She joined us last month
from our offshore office in Bangalore.

27
00:01:28.860 --> 00:01:33.640
She will aid with the software testing
in the latter stages of this project,"

28
00:01:34.240 --> 00:01:38.040
Andrew says, looking at the person
sitting beside Amira.

29
00:01:38.820 --> 00:01:41.480
"Now, the task at hand,

30
00:01:41.480 --> 00:01:44.420
the Project Mercury will move along

31
00:01:44.420 --> 00:01:46.720
with several streams in parallel

32
00:01:46.720 --> 00:01:49.820
and our team is responsible for delivering

33
00:01:49.820 --> 00:01:53.260
a working sample to the client
portfolio website.

34
00:01:53.720 --> 00:01:57.820
Our immediate goal is to get
the sample application

35
00:01:57.820 --> 00:02:00.700
running on the on-premise
development servers.

36
00:02:00.700 --> 00:02:04.860
We will use it for the client
demonstration on July 15th."

37
00:02:05.700 --> 00:02:08.380
"That's less than three weeks from now,"

38
00:02:08.700 --> 00:02:10.380
Bob thinks to himself.

39
00:02:11.280 --> 00:02:12.920
Andrew carries on,

40
00:02:12.920 --> 00:02:15.460
"After a long discussion,

41
00:02:15.460 --> 00:02:20.320
or should I say a distro war
amongst the IT team,

42
00:02:20.320 --> 00:02:25.160
we finally decided to make
use of Ubuntu for the Dev Servers.

43
00:02:25.160 --> 00:02:29.220
If things go well,
we may be looking at deploying

44
00:02:29.220 --> 00:02:31.100
this application in the cloud,

45
00:02:31.100 --> 00:02:35.380
perhaps on a VM
running a Debian distribution

46
00:02:35.380 --> 00:02:38.460
or maybe Centos or even Redhat.

47
00:02:38.460 --> 00:02:42.080
We may even have
to containerize the whole thing

48
00:02:42.080 --> 00:02:44.240
and run it as microservices

49
00:02:44.240 --> 00:02:47.120
on a managed cloud
Kubernetes environment."

50
00:02:47.860 --> 00:02:49.280
He looks at Bob,

51
00:02:49.280 --> 00:02:53.000
"Hence the reason you have got
an Ubuntu laptop.

52
00:02:54.140 --> 00:02:55.880
Donald will fill you in

53
00:02:55.880 --> 00:02:58.380
with the details of the work
done so far

54
00:02:58.380 --> 00:03:01.000
and Amira will send you the project plan,"

55
00:03:01.780 --> 00:03:02.980
he adds.

56
00:03:02.980 --> 00:03:05.600
"I would suggest you connect with Dave

57
00:03:05.600 --> 00:03:07.480
when you get some time to spare.

58
00:03:07.480 --> 00:03:11.100
He will be your go-to man
if you run into any issues

59
00:03:11.100 --> 00:03:14.100
using the new OS. Right.

60
00:03:14.100 --> 00:03:16.240
That's all I had to say.

61
00:03:16.240 --> 00:03:20.500
I am sure you all have very
important work to do

62
00:03:20.500 --> 00:03:22.700
so I won't take any more of your time."

63
00:03:23.560 --> 00:03:26.400
He glances over at Bob before leaving.

64
00:03:27.020 --> 00:03:30.600
"Make sure that you stick
to the project timelines, Bob."

65
00:03:31.200 --> 00:03:32.880
Bob nods along.

66
00:03:33.720 --> 00:03:36.620
He is glad that he has a senior resource

67
00:03:36.620 --> 00:03:38.960
like Donald onboard
who can guide them

68
00:03:38.960 --> 00:03:40.740
with such a crucial project.

69
00:03:41.980 --> 00:03:47.520
June 26th, 11:00 AM,
18 days before the demo.

70
00:03:48.300 --> 00:03:52.720
Back at his desk, Bob sees
that he has a few new emails

71
00:03:52.720 --> 00:03:53.900
from his new colleagues.

72
00:03:53.900 --> 00:03:57.120
The first one was a welcome email from Amira.

73
00:03:57.120 --> 00:04:00.180
There was also a forwarded email from her,

74
00:04:00.180 --> 00:04:03.880
which had the high-level timelines
for the Project Mercury.

75
00:04:04.640 --> 00:04:07.640
Bob then sees a few emails from Donald.

76
00:04:08.100 --> 00:04:11.300
The first one was a forward and it read,

77
00:04:11.300 --> 00:04:14.420
"Bob, please take care of this ASAP."

78
00:04:15.140 --> 00:04:19.040
He scrolls down and sees
a never-ending email thread.

79
00:04:19.560 --> 00:04:22.900
"What is this?" Bob thinks to himself.

80
00:04:23.780 --> 00:04:27.740
"Is this the technical documentation
related to Project Mercury?"

81
00:04:28.240 --> 00:04:29.300
He wonders.

82
00:04:29.780 --> 00:04:32.420
He takes time to read through the email.

83
00:04:33.880 --> 00:04:37.820
"Judging by the content,
this can't be related to Project Mercury.

84
00:04:38.540 --> 00:04:41.980
For one, this thread started three months ago."

85
00:04:42.660 --> 00:04:45.020
Somewhere in the sea of information,

86
00:04:45.020 --> 00:04:48.040
he reads the words "Project Sapphire."

87
00:04:48.540 --> 00:04:52.180
"Okay. This is definitely for another project.

88
00:04:52.180 --> 00:04:55.400
Perhaps Donald wants me to help him with this

89
00:04:55.400 --> 00:04:57.680
before I get started on project mercury,"

90
00:04:58.280 --> 00:04:59.480
Bob thinks.

91
00:05:00.640 --> 00:05:02.580
"I need more context though."

92
00:05:03.300 --> 00:05:06.980
He tries to reach Donald,
but he is nowhere to be seen.

93
00:05:07.540 --> 00:05:10.100
Bob then tries to connect
with him on Skype,

94
00:05:10.720 --> 00:05:14.260
but Donald had set his status to,
"Do not disturb."

95
00:05:15.180 --> 00:05:16.780
Bob is annoyed.

96
00:05:16.780 --> 00:05:19.920
He finds two other emails from Donald

97
00:05:19.920 --> 00:05:21.520
that are similar to the first one,

98
00:05:21.520 --> 00:05:24.820
asking Bob to take care of something ASAP.

99
00:05:25.740 --> 00:05:30.200
The last email from Donald,
however, is titled, Project Mercury.

100
00:05:30.200 --> 00:05:35.480
Bob opens it excitedly and sees
that it has 12 attachments.

101
00:05:36.120 --> 00:05:38.480
While reading through the design document,

102
00:05:38.480 --> 00:05:40.180
Bob gets a phone call.

103
00:05:40.700 --> 00:05:43.260
It was a client who was seeking an update

104
00:05:43.260 --> 00:05:44.960
related to Project Sapphire.

105
00:05:45.800 --> 00:05:49.900
Bob tries to reach Donald
but is again unsuccessful.

106
00:05:50.600 --> 00:05:53.120
"I guess I will have to handle this myself."

107
00:05:54.060 --> 00:05:58.080
He spends the rest of the day
trying to figure out the issues.

108
00:06:00.480 --> 00:06:05.280
June 28th, 2:00 PM, 16 days before the demo.

109
00:06:06.040 --> 00:06:09.440
Bob has been quite busy
for the past few days

110
00:06:09.440 --> 00:06:13.500
responding to client escalations
for the Project Sapphire.

111
00:06:14.340 --> 00:06:18.500
Donald had been forwarding him
escalation emails every day.

112
00:06:19.200 --> 00:06:22.380
He hasn't had the time to check out chapter two

113
00:06:22.380 --> 00:06:23.600
from the self-start guide.

114
00:06:24.420 --> 00:06:28.000
While he is comfortable
with the commands from chapter one,

115
00:06:28.000 --> 00:06:31.300
he was not sure how things work in Linux.

116
00:06:32.180 --> 00:06:35.580
One of the things he was particularly
having trouble with

117
00:06:35.580 --> 00:06:39.840
was understanding the names
and use of directories in Linux.

118
00:06:40.920 --> 00:06:44.780
He knew that the /home
directory is the location

119
00:06:44.780 --> 00:06:47.020
where his home directory is created,

120
00:06:47.740 --> 00:06:50.060
"But what are these other directories,

121
00:06:50.060 --> 00:06:57.060
/ETC, /USR, /VAR, /TMP,

122
00:06:57.060 --> 00:07:00.640
and /DEV,"
Bob wondered.

123
00:07:01.360 --> 00:07:03.720
He was sure he did not create them.

124
00:07:04.300 --> 00:07:07.280
"Perhaps they were created
during the installation?"

125
00:07:08.000 --> 00:07:12.580
He had also come across
the term Linux Kernel quite a lot.

126
00:07:13.120 --> 00:07:16.280
He had heard about the Kernel
while working with Windows

127
00:07:16.280 --> 00:07:18.460
but was not sure what it was.

128
00:07:19.180 --> 00:07:22.320
With his questions increasing day by day,

129
00:07:22.320 --> 00:07:25.680
Bob decides to initiate contact with Dave

130
00:07:25.680 --> 00:07:27.280
and calls him on Skype.

131
00:07:28.140 --> 00:07:30.880
Dave is delighted to talk to Bob

132
00:07:30.880 --> 00:07:33.480
and welcomes him again to the organization.

133
00:07:34.080 --> 00:07:37.260
After a bit of small talk,
Bob seeks advice

134
00:07:37.260 --> 00:07:39.800
from Dave to get his questions clarified.

135
00:07:40.620 --> 00:07:45.060
"I think it's better if we can do
this over an in-person session.

136
00:07:45.060 --> 00:07:47.820
I would be happy to answer your questions.

137
00:07:48.400 --> 00:07:52.320
Better yet, let's arrange a training
session to understand

138
00:07:52.320 --> 00:07:54.200
the core concepts in Linux.

139
00:07:54.200 --> 00:07:55.520
Would you like that?"

140
00:07:56.160 --> 00:07:59.020
"Absolutely, that would be amazing.

141
00:07:59.020 --> 00:08:00.700
Thank you so much.

142
00:08:00.700 --> 00:08:02.700
Let me block some time with you."

143
00:08:03.260 --> 00:08:06.000
"Sounds good. See you soon."

144
00:08:07.560 --> 00:08:09.460
"You look like a ghost,"

145
00:08:09.880 --> 00:08:12.840
says Dave, beckoning him to the meeting room.

146
00:08:12.840 --> 00:08:16.880
"Busy start to your career here?" he asks.

147
00:08:17.380 --> 00:08:19.300
Bob smiles weakly.

148
00:08:19.300 --> 00:08:22.920
"You can say that,
I did not look outside

149
00:08:22.920 --> 00:08:25.940
the window once on my train ride to work today.

150
00:08:25.940 --> 00:08:29.200
I've been handling
client escalations all week."

151
00:08:31.200 --> 00:08:33.560
"Your dreams are already coming true.

152
00:08:33.560 --> 00:08:36.180
You're one of us now,"

153
00:08:36.780 --> 00:08:38.180
Dave laughs.

154
00:08:38.180 --> 00:08:40.320
Bob joins in the laughter,

155
00:08:41.240 --> 00:08:45.600
"On a serious note,
aren't you assigned to Project Mercury?

156
00:08:45.600 --> 00:08:48.440
Why do you have escalation calls already?"

157
00:08:48.440 --> 00:08:50.080
Asks Dave.

158
00:08:50.620 --> 00:08:55.800
"Donald for my team assigned me
some tasks from Project Sapphire,

159
00:08:55.800 --> 00:08:59.860
so I'm helping out with that as well,"
Bob replies.

160
00:09:00.480 --> 00:09:02.880
"I'm working on Project Mercury, too.

161
00:09:02.880 --> 00:09:05.120
Just got the technical requirements.

162
00:09:05.120 --> 00:09:08.240
Lots to be done," says Bob.

163
00:09:08.780 --> 00:09:10.940
Dave raises his eyebrows.

164
00:09:12.400 --> 00:09:16.300
"Donald. A word of advice, Bob.

165
00:09:16.300 --> 00:09:19.320
I think you should prioritize the work

166
00:09:19.320 --> 00:09:21.900
for Project Mercury over other things,

167
00:09:21.900 --> 00:09:24.860
and that's what Andrew
would expect from you, too,

168
00:09:25.380 --> 00:09:31.880
and how do I put this mildly?
Technically speaking,

169
00:09:31.880 --> 00:09:34.240
Donald is not your manager,

170
00:09:34.240 --> 00:09:37.720
so you don't have to take
every task you get from him.

171
00:09:37.720 --> 00:09:40.680
That's all I will say on that matter."

172
00:09:41.540 --> 00:09:45.420
Bob finds this to be very unusual advice

173
00:09:45.420 --> 00:09:46.780
but does not respond.

174
00:09:48.020 --> 00:09:50.720
"Right," he claps his hand,

175
00:09:50.720 --> 00:09:54.680
"Ready to learn some Linux?" He smiles.

176
00:09:54.680 --> 00:09:57.600
Bob nods, "Yes, of course."

177
00:09:58.160 --> 00:10:02.300
"This will not be just a boring
lecture with just theory.

178
00:10:03.140 --> 00:10:05.540
We call this room the lab.

179
00:10:06.340 --> 00:10:08.440
It's not your typical meeting room.

180
00:10:09.000 --> 00:10:10.900
See those computers over there,

181
00:10:10.900 --> 00:10:14.520
they will give you online
access to a temporary

182
00:10:14.520 --> 00:10:16.840
environment with hands-on labs,

183
00:10:16.840 --> 00:10:19.960
similar to the one you must have already seen

184
00:10:19.960 --> 00:10:22.960
with the quickstart guide," says Dave.

185
00:10:23.620 --> 00:10:26.980
He continues,
"You will get to play around

186
00:10:26.980 --> 00:10:29.180
on a real operating system

187
00:10:29.180 --> 00:10:31.720
and try out things along with my lecture,

188
00:10:32.140 --> 00:10:34.760
and don't worry about
messing up something.

189
00:10:34.760 --> 00:10:38.200
These environments are set up in such a way

190
00:10:38.200 --> 00:10:40.800
that they will be destroyed after an hour

191
00:10:40.800 --> 00:10:43.200
and recreated when you need them again."

192
00:10:44.020 --> 00:10:45.940
"That is super cool.

193
00:10:45.940 --> 00:10:48.640
Let's start," says Bob.
