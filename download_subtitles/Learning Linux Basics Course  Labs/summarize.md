Summary of Sections 8 to 10
Section 8: Service Management with SYSTEMD
Concepts:
SYSTEMD is a system and service manager for Linux operating systems. It is responsible for initializing the system and managing services.
Service Units: SYSTEMD uses unit files to manage services. These files define how services should be started, stopped, and managed.
Important Points:
Creating a Service: A basic service unit file includes sections like [Unit], [Service], and [Install].
Dependencies: You can define service dependencies using the After directive to ensure services start in the correct order.
Editing Services: Use systemctl edit <service>.service --full to modify service unit files.
Commands:
systemctl start <service>: Start a service.
systemctl stop <service>: Stop a service.
systemctl status <service>: Check the status of a service.
systemctl daemon-reload: Reload the system manager configuration after changes to unit files.
journalctl: View logs for troubleshooting.
Section 9: Storage in Linux
Concepts:
Disk Partitions: Dividing a disk into segments to manage storage efficiently.
File Systems: Structures that define how data is stored and retrieved on a disk.
External Storage: Includes DAS (Direct Attached Storage), NAS (Network Attached Storage), and SAN (Storage Area Network).
Important Points:
Partitioning: Allows segmentation of disk space for different uses.
File Systems: EXT4 is a common file system in Linux, and NFS is used for network file sharing.
LVM (Logical Volume Manager): Allows flexible disk management by grouping multiple physical volumes into a volume group.
Commands:
lsblk: List block devices.
fdisk: Partition a disk.
mkfs: Create a file system on a partition.
mount: Mount a file system.
lvcreate: Create a logical volume.
Section 10: The Client Demonstration
Concepts:
Project Management: Involves planning, executing, and closing projects.
Troubleshooting: Identifying and resolving issues in a development environment.
Important Points:
Environment Differences: Issues can arise due to differences between development and production environments.
Collaboration: Effective communication and teamwork are crucial for project success.
Continuous Learning: Staying updated with the latest technology trends is essential.
Commands:
While specific commands are not highlighted in this section, the focus is on understanding the environment and using tools like telnet for network testing.
