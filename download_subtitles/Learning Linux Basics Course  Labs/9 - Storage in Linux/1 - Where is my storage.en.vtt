00:00:01.000 --> 00:00:03.360
July 9th - 9:00 AM

2
00:00:03.360 --> 00:00:06.000
5 days before the demo.

3
00:00:07.820 --> 00:00:10.750
The client demonstration is just
around the corner,

4
00:00:10.760 --> 00:00:13.500
and Bob has been working very hard.

5
00:00:13.500 --> 00:00:18.600
His final task is to migrate
the Django project from his laptop

6
00:00:18.600 --> 00:00:19.867
to the dev servers.

7
00:00:19.867 --> 00:00:21.733
While working on the shell,

8
00:00:21.733 --> 00:00:26.200
he tries to download a large file
into his home directory.

9
00:00:26.200 --> 00:00:28.633
The download fails after a while

10
00:00:28.633 --> 00:00:31.667
with an error; no space on device.

11
00:00:31.667 --> 00:00:34.733
He runs a DF command and sees that

12
00:00:34.733 --> 00:00:37.967
his home directory is 95% full.

13
00:00:37.967 --> 00:00:41.000
He also sees that
all the mounts

14
00:00:41.000 --> 00:00:45.467
in the DF command
added up to about 50GB in total.

15
00:00:45.467 --> 00:00:49.100
"Didn't it say on the box
that this laptop has

16
00:00:49.101 --> 00:00:52.567
a 128G SSD disk?

17
00:00:52.567 --> 00:00:54.967
Where is the rest of the storage?

18
00:00:54.967 --> 00:00:59.267
Hmm.
I'll have to get this checked with Dave",

19
00:00:59.267 --> 00:01:03.433
thinks Bob,
"But first I need some coffee"

20
00:01:03.433 --> 00:01:06.967
Bob decides to
head down to the cafeteria.

21
00:01:06.967 --> 00:01:11.500
He sees Dave at the counter.
He is in a deep conversation

22
00:01:11.500 --> 00:01:12.967
with another colleague.

23
00:01:12.967 --> 00:01:15.867
Dave spots Bob and calls him over.

24
00:01:15.867 --> 00:01:18.833
Morning Bob! Come on over.

25
00:01:18.833 --> 00:01:20.900
I want to introduce you to

26
00:01:20.900 --> 00:01:25.567
Mohanarajan Manivannan,
our resident Storage Admin.

27
00:01:25.567 --> 00:01:30.333
"You can call me Mohan,"
says Mohanarajan.

28
00:01:30.333 --> 00:01:35.433
"Mohan was just telling me that
we are running out of space

29
00:01:35.433 --> 00:01:39.667
on our production SAN appliance,"
says Dave.

30
00:01:39.667 --> 00:01:43.267
"This is Bob. He's our
new front end developer

31
00:01:43.267 --> 00:01:46.700
who joined the Project Mercury team
two weeks ago."

32
00:01:46.700 --> 00:01:50.133
Bob and Mohan exchanged pleasantries,

33
00:01:50.133 --> 00:01:52.367
and Bob introduces himself.

34
00:01:52.367 --> 00:01:55.867
Bob says, "Dave has been terrific.

35
00:01:55.867 --> 00:01:58.900
He has helped me break into
the world of Linux

36
00:01:58.900 --> 00:02:01.033
after the end Initial hiccups.

37
00:02:01.033 --> 00:02:04.633
I am now fairly comfortable
working in this new environment."

38
00:02:04.633 --> 00:02:08.700
Mohan replies: That's fantastic!

39
00:02:08.700 --> 00:02:11.433
Yes, I remember having
the exact experience

40
00:02:11.433 --> 00:02:13.733
when I joined the firm
eight years ago!

41
00:02:13.733 --> 00:02:15.833
Dave helped me a lot too!

42
00:02:15.833 --> 00:02:21.767
Those days, we used to work on
Fedora 16 and RHEL5.

43
00:02:21.767 --> 00:02:25.000
Things have changed
so much since then!"

44
00:02:25.000 --> 00:02:26.867
Good to know.

45
00:02:26.867 --> 00:02:30.267
I think either of you can help me
understand the storage problem.

46
00:02:30.267 --> 00:02:33.733
I've been seeing on my laptop", says Bob.

47
00:02:33.733 --> 00:02:37.833
"Sorry, Bob.
I have to join an escalation call

48
00:02:37.833 --> 00:02:39.300
in another five minutes.

49
00:02:39.300 --> 00:02:41.867
In fact, I have to leave
right now."

50
00:02:41.867 --> 00:02:45.233
Says Dave, looking at his mobile.

51
00:02:45.233 --> 00:02:50.267
He adds, "Mohan, do you mind
taking a look at Bob's question?

52
00:02:50.267 --> 00:02:52.667
He is a learning machine."

53
00:02:52.667 --> 00:02:54.633
He says, laughing.

54
00:02:54.633 --> 00:02:57.100
In fact, if you have some time to spare,

55
00:02:57.100 --> 00:03:00.067
can you arrange a
storage session with them?"

56
00:03:00.067 --> 00:03:03.033
Mohan smiles, "No problem.

57
00:03:03.033 --> 00:03:05.467
I am free pretty much
every day this week.

58
00:03:05.467 --> 00:03:10.067
So, Bob, just find a suitable slot
and send me a meeting invite."

59
00:03:10.067 --> 00:03:14.067
Bob is excited.
That would be great.

60
00:03:14.067 --> 00:03:16.400
Thank you so much, both of you.

61
00:03:17.180 --> 00:03:20.300
Bob arranges a session later that day.

62
00:03:21.500 --> 00:03:24.900
Later that afternoon, while walking
towards the meeting room

63
00:03:24.900 --> 00:03:26.433
to meet Mohan,

64
00:03:26.433 --> 00:03:29.167
Bob walks past a crowded conference room.

65
00:03:29.167 --> 00:03:32.667
He could see Dave, Donald,
and some other people

66
00:03:32.667 --> 00:03:36.467
he hadn't met inside the
room talking animatedly.

67
00:03:36.467 --> 00:03:39.833
Bob takes a quick glance
at the name of the room.

68
00:03:39.833 --> 00:03:45.500
It read: 7A-052 PROJECT SAPPHIRE.

69
00:03:45.500 --> 00:03:48.833
Someone had scribbled a
couple of words underneath

70
00:03:48.833 --> 00:03:51.133
with a permanent marker that said,

71
00:03:51.133 --> 00:03:56.200
WORK AT RISK MEETING.
Booked, 9-5 until July 10th.

72
00:03:56.200 --> 00:04:01.867
"Ah! So that's the meaning of WAR Meeting."
thinks Bob.

73
00:04:01.867 --> 00:04:04.800
Glad that he was not
part of that meeting.

74
00:04:05.500 --> 00:04:12.400
He carries on and meets up with Mohan
in the adjacent room.
