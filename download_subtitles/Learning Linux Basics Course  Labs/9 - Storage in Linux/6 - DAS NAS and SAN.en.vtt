00:00:01.095 --> 00:00:04.325
"Now that you are familiar with
the basics of storage in Linux,

2
00:00:04.588 --> 00:00:06.994
I feel it's a good time
to give a quick overview

3
00:00:07.162 --> 00:00:11.347
of commonly used external storage,"
says Mohan.

4
00:00:11.826 --> 00:00:15.548
"Why do we use external storage?"
Asks Bob.

5
00:00:15.975 --> 00:00:20.539
Mohan replies, "For a desktop
environment, such as your laptop,

6
00:00:20.783 --> 00:00:23.727
we can get away with using
the onboard storage

7
00:00:23.895 --> 00:00:27.021
or attaching an external drive
for our data needs."

8
00:00:27.549 --> 00:00:30.878
He explains that this is not feasible
for an enterprise-grade

9
00:00:31.101 --> 00:00:34.156
server environment
such as a production database

10
00:00:34.345 --> 00:00:37.091
or a web server
storing a lot of data.

11
00:00:37.445 --> 00:00:41.604
As a result, they make use
of enterprise-grade high capacity

12
00:00:41.663 --> 00:00:44.449
external storage
with high availability.

13
00:00:44.751 --> 00:00:47.942
We're going to see three
different types of storage here.

14
00:00:48.480 --> 00:00:51.805
The DAS,
which is the Direct Attached Storage.

15
00:00:52.131 --> 00:00:55.083
The NAS,
which is Network Attached Storage

16
00:00:55.131 --> 00:00:58.575
and quite similar
to the NFS server we saw earlier.

17
00:00:58.785 --> 00:01:03.682
Finally, the SAN,
which is the Storage Area Network.

18
00:01:04.101 --> 00:01:08.982
This technology uses a fiber channel
for providing high-speed storage.

19
00:01:10.774 --> 00:01:14.099
With DAS,
external storage is attached directly

20
00:01:14.231 --> 00:01:17.398
to the host system
that requires the space.

21
00:01:17.861 --> 00:01:21.369
The host operating system
sees a connected desk device

22
00:01:21.432 --> 00:01:23.092
as a blocked device.

23
00:01:23.320 --> 00:01:27.050
There is no network or firewall
between the storage and the host,

24
00:01:27.339 --> 00:01:32.212
which means this provides excellent
performance at a very affordable cost.

25
00:01:32.534 --> 00:01:36.224
DAS generally has a faster response
than a NAS device

26
00:01:36.392 --> 00:01:38.773
where the data traffic
goes over the network.

27
00:01:39.109 --> 00:01:43.006
The downside is that
since the DAS is directly attached,

28
00:01:43.199 --> 00:01:45.524
it is dedicated to a single server.

29
00:01:45.902 --> 00:01:49.339
As a result, this is not ideal
for enterprise environments

30
00:01:49.386 --> 00:01:51.656
where multiple servers
need storage

31
00:01:51.839 --> 00:01:54.815
and is more suitable
for small businesses.

32
00:01:56.196 --> 00:02:00.093
NAS, on the other hand, is suitable
for mid to large businesses.

33
00:02:00.459 --> 00:02:03.896
NAS stands for
Network Attached Storage,

34
00:02:04.137 --> 00:02:07.525
which means that the NAS
storage device is generally located

35
00:02:07.693 --> 00:02:10.910
apart from the hosts
that will consume space from it.

36
00:02:11.530 --> 00:02:15.633
The data traffic between the storage
and the host is through the network.

37
00:02:16.318 --> 00:02:19.977
The physical distance between the two
may not be significant.

38
00:02:20.288 --> 00:02:24.169
They may be located in the same rack
in a data center, for example.

39
00:02:24.486 --> 00:02:27.868
Yet, the data would have to traverse
through the network.

40
00:02:28.467 --> 00:02:32.412
If you notice this simple
architecture diagram of a NAS system,

41
00:02:32.683 --> 00:02:36.278
you will notice that this
is quite similar to the NFS server.

42
00:02:36.701 --> 00:02:39.748
This is because
NAS is a file storage device,

43
00:02:39.812 --> 00:02:45.124
unlike DAS and SAN both of which
are our block storage devices.

44
00:02:45.623 --> 00:02:49.258
The storage is provided to the hosts
in the form of a directory

45
00:02:49.470 --> 00:02:52.669
or a share that is physically present
in the NAS device

46
00:02:52.842 --> 00:02:55.898
but exported via NFS to the hosts.

47
00:02:56.274 --> 00:02:58.440
As a result,
this type of storage

48
00:02:58.623 --> 00:03:01.331
is ideal for centralized
shared storage that

49
00:03:01.499 --> 00:03:05.784
needs to be accessed simultaneously
by several different hosts.

50
00:03:06.272 --> 00:03:09.613
The performance of the NAS
and high-speed ethernet connectivity

51
00:03:09.663 --> 00:03:13.178
between the two,
it can provide good performance

52
00:03:13.359 --> 00:03:15.979
and highly available
storage solution.

53
00:03:16.339 --> 00:03:19.426
This type of storage
can be used as the back-end storage

54
00:03:19.521 --> 00:03:22.109
for web servers
or application servers

55
00:03:22.267 --> 00:03:24.038
and can even run databases,

56
00:03:24.231 --> 00:03:27.318
although not recommended
for production workloads.

57
00:03:27.775 --> 00:03:32.633
NAS is not a recommended storage
to install operating systems.

58
00:03:34.286 --> 00:03:37.754
The last type of external storage
we will see is the SAN,

59
00:03:37.977 --> 00:03:40.262
which is the Storage Area Network.

60
00:03:40.751 --> 00:03:43.942
SAN provides block storage
used by enterprises

61
00:03:44.013 --> 00:03:46.966
for business-critical applications
that need to deliver

62
00:03:47.037 --> 00:03:49.561
high throughput and low latency.

63
00:03:49.850 --> 00:03:53.310
Storage is allocated to hosts
in the form of a LUN,

64
00:03:53.655 --> 00:03:56.178
which stands for Logical Unit Number.

65
00:03:56.570 --> 00:03:58.737
A LUN is a range of blocks

66
00:03:58.801 --> 00:04:01.285
provisioned from
a pool of shared storage

67
00:04:01.401 --> 00:04:04.536
and presented to the server
as a logical disk.

68
00:04:05.056 --> 00:04:08.771
The host system will detect
this storage as a raw disk.

69
00:04:09.020 --> 00:04:12.750
We can then create partitions
and file systems on top of it

70
00:04:13.030 --> 00:04:15.363
as we would
with any other block device

71
00:04:15.572 --> 00:04:18.382
and then mount it on the system
to store data.

72
00:04:18.953 --> 00:04:24.116
While SAN can also be ethernet-based,
it mainly makes use of the FCP,

73
00:04:24.323 --> 00:04:26.950
which stands for
Fiber Channel Protocol.

74
00:04:27.242 --> 00:04:29.972
This is a high-speed data transfer
protocol that

75
00:04:30.029 --> 00:04:32.204
makes use of a fiber channel switch

76
00:04:32.411 --> 00:04:35.093
to establish communication
with the host.

77
00:04:35.648 --> 00:04:40.402
The host servers make use of HBA,
or a Host Bus Adaptor,

78
00:04:40.667 --> 00:04:42.580
which is connected to the PCI slot

79
00:04:42.620 --> 00:04:45.688
to interface with
the fiber channel switch.

80
00:04:46.061 --> 00:04:48.934
The major advantage of SAN over NAS

81
00:04:49.131 --> 00:04:52.702
is that it can be used to host
mission-critical applications

82
00:04:52.767 --> 00:04:57.982
and databases due to its vastly
superior performance and reliability.

83
00:04:58.411 --> 00:05:04.243
These include installing
Oracle Databases or Microsoft SQL DB,

84
00:05:04.540 --> 00:05:07.064
using it for
virtualization deployments

85
00:05:07.267 --> 00:05:11.767
such as VMware, KVM,
or Microsoft Hyper â€“V.
