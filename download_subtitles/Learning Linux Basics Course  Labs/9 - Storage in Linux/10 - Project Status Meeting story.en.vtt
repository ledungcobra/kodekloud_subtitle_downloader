00:00:00.780 --> 00:00:05.160
July 10th, 9:00 AM, four days before the demo.

2
00:00:05.900 --> 00:00:07.200
The team is attending attending

3
00:00:07.240 --> 00:00:08.880
an in person team meeting.

4
00:00:09.460 --> 00:00:12.160
Bob is now on track with the project delivery.

5
00:00:12.760 --> 00:00:13.740
He demonstrates

6
00:00:13.780 --> 00:00:16.180
the working web application on his laptop.

7
00:00:17.080 --> 00:00:19.260
Andrew is pretty happy with the progress.

8
00:00:19.980 --> 00:00:23.780
"This looks really good. Excellent work, Bob,"

9
00:00:24.320 --> 00:00:25.060
says Andrew.

10
00:00:25.780 --> 00:00:27.020
"What do you think, Donald?

11
00:00:27.380 --> 00:00:29.360
You look like you want to say something,"

12
00:00:30.020 --> 00:00:30.840
he asks.

13
00:00:31.760 --> 00:00:33.940
Donald takes another dig at Bob,

14
00:00:35.440 --> 00:00:37.460
"While the core aspects have been addressed,

15
00:00:37.920 --> 00:00:39.820
I think we are still missing

16
00:00:39.900 --> 00:00:41.220
some of the new features

17
00:00:41.260 --> 00:00:44.220
the client asked us to add," says Donald.

18
00:00:45.560 --> 00:00:48.180
"Bob, I had sent it over to you earlier this week,

19
00:00:48.660 --> 00:00:50.360
please make sure that these are added

20
00:00:50.400 --> 00:00:52.780
in the final version," he adds.

21
00:00:54.180 --> 00:00:55.660
Bob thinks to himself,

22
00:00:56.280 --> 00:00:58.320
" This guy, doesn't he ever have

23
00:00:58.360 --> 00:00:59.700
something nice to say?

24
00:01:00.160 --> 00:01:01.800
How am I going to work with him

25
00:01:01.840 --> 00:01:04.640
in the same team for the rest of the project?"

26
00:01:05.600 --> 00:01:08.400
"Amira, please add the new requests

27
00:01:08.440 --> 00:01:10.380
from the client to the project plan

28
00:01:10.700 --> 00:01:12.100
and make sure they're tracked.

29
00:01:13.100 --> 00:01:14.560
Bob, please fix them

30
00:01:14.600 --> 00:01:16.180
before the end of the day today."
