00:00:13.920 --> 00:00:17.310
Hello, and welcome to the Linux Basics course. My name is Michael Forrester,

2
00:00:17.310 --> 00:00:21.990
and welcome to KodeKloud. Why learn Linux? Why do we care about operating systems?

3
00:00:22.330 --> 00:00:25.790
Why do we have a Linux Basics course? How does this relate to DevOps?

4
00:00:26.650 --> 00:00:29.070
So, Stack Overflow has some insights,

5
00:00:29.130 --> 00:00:33.710
and these are verified by other platforms on the internet that Linux is by far

6
00:00:33.730 --> 00:00:37.030
the most predominant server operating system used in the world.

7
00:00:37.540 --> 00:00:39.630
This includes Linux and all of its flavors.

8
00:00:40.450 --> 00:00:44.590
All of the 500 fastest supercomputers in the world, they run on Linux,

9
00:00:44.970 --> 00:00:49.830
96.3% of the top 1 million websites that we go

10
00:00:49.830 --> 00:00:52.710
to, they run on Linux. And, oddly enough,

11
00:00:52.710 --> 00:00:57.350
86% of all smartphones are powered by Linux, as of this recording.

12
00:00:58.170 --> 00:00:59.870
Now, in the cloud and the DevOps world,

13
00:01:00.500 --> 00:01:03.590
many of the new tools that have come out within the last

14
00:01:03.590 --> 00:01:05.790
five to seven years, or even more recently,

15
00:01:06.460 --> 00:01:10.590
were developed and used in Linux environments before they made it to any other

16
00:01:10.590 --> 00:01:12.230
operating system. This includes Windows,

17
00:01:12.680 --> 00:01:15.630
which is the other server operating system, and Mac,

18
00:01:15.630 --> 00:01:17.950
which isn't really used as a server. For example,

19
00:01:18.330 --> 00:01:22.910
containerization tools like Docker was only available on Linux-based systems

20
00:01:23.250 --> 00:01:28.190
for many, many years before it got to Windows support. Similarly,

21
00:01:28.190 --> 00:01:32.110
automation and configuration management tools like Ansible required to be

22
00:01:32.110 --> 00:01:36.270
installed on a Linux environment in order to be used. And so, even though,

23
00:01:36.270 --> 00:01:36.980
for example,

24
00:01:36.980 --> 00:01:41.350
Ansible can manage Windows Systems as a target for configuration,

25
00:01:41.910 --> 00:01:45.710
a Linux system is required to be the actual controller for Linux if you decide

26
00:01:45.710 --> 00:01:50.110
to centralize it. Now, in case of container orchestration tools like

27
00:01:50.610 --> 00:01:53.150
Kubernetes, for example, which does container orchestration, right?

28
00:01:53.490 --> 00:01:57.830
In case of using things like Kubernetes, the primary nodes, the control plane,

29
00:01:57.930 --> 00:01:59.710
the master nodes for

30
00:02:00.170 --> 00:02:02.990
Kubernetes can actually only be Linux systems.

31
00:02:03.530 --> 00:02:07.390
And the documentation as of this recording says that there are no plans to have

32
00:02:07.470 --> 00:02:10.590
a Windows-only Kubernetes cluster as of this recording,

33
00:02:10.880 --> 00:02:15.510
which means you're always going to need at least Linux to actually run the control

34
00:02:15.510 --> 00:02:17.190
plane even if your data plane has Windows.

35
00:02:18.370 --> 00:02:21.630
So, when you go through our Kubernetes series of courses and you're setting up a

36
00:02:21.790 --> 00:02:22.623
Kubernetes cluster,

37
00:02:22.700 --> 00:02:25.110
it's all done on Linux because you're going to have to do it on Linux.

38
00:02:25.420 --> 00:02:28.390
This is true for almost all of the certification exams, right?

39
00:02:28.610 --> 00:02:31.790
The Kubernetes and the RedHat Ansible certification exams, for example,

40
00:02:31.930 --> 00:02:33.390
are all done on Linux systems.

41
00:02:33.970 --> 00:02:37.390
So, if you plan to learn these tools and technologies and you want to get yourself

42
00:02:37.390 --> 00:02:38.223
certified,

43
00:02:38.330 --> 00:02:42.830
it is extremely important to have the knowledge of the basics of the Linux

44
00:02:42.830 --> 00:02:43.663
operating system.

45
00:02:44.410 --> 00:02:47.510
So, the DevOps trend in the IT industry is growing exponentially,

46
00:02:47.810 --> 00:02:52.070
and you're going to see the demand for DevOps and cloud engineers just

47
00:02:52.300 --> 00:02:53.133
skyrocket.

48
00:02:53.570 --> 00:02:56.830
So, every new job position that you see now requires at least the basic knowledge

49
00:02:56.830 --> 00:02:59.320
of DevOps tooling, the basic knowledge of Linux,

50
00:02:59.490 --> 00:03:02.200
basic knowledge of cloud, with notable exceptions, right?

51
00:03:02.500 --> 00:03:06.120
And so this demand is just expected to grow. This is not going to go down,

52
00:03:06.230 --> 00:03:10.440
it's just going to go up. As more and more organizations are adopting

53
00:03:10.900 --> 00:03:13.440
DevOps and running their workloads in the cloud,

54
00:03:14.110 --> 00:03:17.680
fundamental understanding of Linux as an operating system is a must.

55
00:03:19.060 --> 00:03:22.440
And, especially, if you've been working in a Windows-dominated environment,

56
00:03:23.030 --> 00:03:27.320
some of the challenges that we run into when people transition from Windows to

57
00:03:27.480 --> 00:03:29.600
Linux is things like

58
00:03:29.600 --> 00:03:31.800
they have trouble navigating the Linux command line interface.

59
00:03:32.110 --> 00:03:35.800
There's a lack of experience with the Linux command line.

60
00:03:36.260 --> 00:03:38.800
And so troubleshooting is particularly

61
00:03:38.800 --> 00:03:42.560
troublesome. Navigating through directory structures, working with files,

62
00:03:42.560 --> 00:03:45.720
manipulating files, editing files on the command line.

63
00:03:45.970 --> 00:03:48.160
These are all problems that students have run into.

64
00:03:48.330 --> 00:03:49.920
Other issues that students run into,

65
00:03:49.920 --> 00:03:52.480
such as like not having experience with the VI editor,

66
00:03:52.480 --> 00:03:54.280
which is pretty much everywhere,

67
00:03:54.400 --> 00:03:57.840
understanding the differences between the different flavors of Linux, handling

68
00:03:57.840 --> 00:04:01.280
errors during the installation of applications or even the tools that you use to

69
00:04:01.280 --> 00:04:02.320
install those applications,

70
00:04:02.630 --> 00:04:05.760
including things like dependencies and how to configure remote software

71
00:04:05.760 --> 00:04:10.080
repositories. And then also networking in DNS and Linux can be

72
00:04:10.080 --> 00:04:11.320
different depending on the flavor.

73
00:04:12.290 --> 00:04:16.360
Other times, the trouble that you run into when students make that transition is

74
00:04:16.360 --> 00:04:19.960
issues with permissions, things like security, AppArmor, SELinux.

75
00:04:20.230 --> 00:04:23.520
When do you use sudo? How do you configure the permissions? What is it,

76
00:04:23.520 --> 00:04:27.680
what does a sticky bit even mean? Right? And, last but not least,

77
00:04:28.220 --> 00:04:32.600
the most common challenge around learning Linux is that

78
00:04:33.300 --> 00:04:35.000
we don't have sufficient hands-on experience.

79
00:04:35.000 --> 00:04:37.320
There's no opportunity to get into the space.

80
00:04:37.900 --> 00:04:41.040
So, you've got the difficulty of transitioning from Windows and not understanding

81
00:04:41.040 --> 00:04:42.680
the command line and not understanding the concept,

82
00:04:43.340 --> 00:04:46.240
but then getting hands-on is the reason why we built this course.

83
00:04:46.500 --> 00:04:48.560
We want to help you get your foundations right.

84
00:04:49.230 --> 00:04:53.120
Understanding your operating system, which for most of us is Linux,

85
00:04:53.140 --> 00:04:57.960
and for some of you, maybe Windows, is one of the key fundamental skills of a

86
00:04:57.960 --> 00:05:02.240
DevOps engineer. It is a different kind of course. And here's why.

87
00:05:02.590 --> 00:05:04.960
It's not just because of the hands-on experience and all the things we just

88
00:05:04.960 --> 00:05:09.000
talked about. I have a question for you, though, that will help clear this up.

89
00:05:09.510 --> 00:05:12.520
This course is different because, you know, have you read the books

90
00:05:12.780 --> 00:05:15.840
The Phoenix Project and The Unicorn Project? Oh, you haven't?

91
00:05:16.580 --> 00:05:17.800
If you're going to be in DevOps,

92
00:05:18.150 --> 00:05:21.800
reading The Phoenix Project and The Unicorn Project are probably going to be

93
00:05:21.800 --> 00:05:24.800
essential. If you have, you know they're amazing. If you haven't,

94
00:05:25.270 --> 00:05:26.800
then you know that,

95
00:05:27.820 --> 00:05:32.360
you should know that it's a novel about IT and DevOps, and I highly recommend it

96
00:05:32.360 --> 00:05:33.640
to anyone working in IT.

97
00:05:34.460 --> 00:05:37.160
But the interesting thing about these books is that they follow a slightly

98
00:05:37.160 --> 00:05:39.920
different format from any other technical books you might encounter.

99
00:05:40.130 --> 00:05:40.880
These two books,

100
00:05:40.880 --> 00:05:45.440
The Phoenix Project and The Unicorn Project will take you through a journey of

101
00:05:45.660 --> 00:05:50.320
an IT manager and a software developer and their perspectives and challenges

102
00:05:50.780 --> 00:05:54.080
on the development and the deployment of the same project,

103
00:05:54.700 --> 00:05:56.360
but with a very tight deadline.

104
00:05:56.860 --> 00:05:59.320
So, it happens in slightly different perspectives.

105
00:05:59.690 --> 00:06:04.320
These two books describe how they overcome these challenges by implementing a

106
00:06:04.320 --> 00:06:06.160
better working culture between different teams,

107
00:06:06.620 --> 00:06:10.640
by evaluating and implementing different processes and by using tools to

108
00:06:10.880 --> 00:06:14.720
automate tasks for both speed and consistency. They also,

109
00:06:14.730 --> 00:06:18.080
since their books about DevOps just happened to talk about DevOps

110
00:06:18.080 --> 00:06:22.320
principles, like continual improvement, lean thinking, system staking,

111
00:06:22.590 --> 00:06:23.423
it's really good.

112
00:06:23.700 --> 00:06:28.680
So, the story format of these books helps us to understand not just what DevOps

113
00:06:28.680 --> 00:06:31.840
is, but more importantly the common whys of DevOps, for example,

114
00:06:31.860 --> 00:06:33.200
why do we need to change our process?

115
00:06:33.940 --> 00:06:36.000
Why do we need to implement a better working culture?

116
00:06:36.420 --> 00:06:40.120
Why do we need these DevOps tools? What outcome are we seeking?

117
00:06:40.120 --> 00:06:44.320
Why are these people involved? Why is this system constrained system?

118
00:06:44.480 --> 00:06:46.840
Questions that are commonly asked, like, why do we need to be collaborative?

119
00:06:46.840 --> 00:06:49.800
Why do we need to talk to people, right? Why do we need to automate this?

120
00:06:50.580 --> 00:06:52.960
All really important questions in a DevOps culture.

121
00:06:53.780 --> 00:06:57.720
So, as a result of that story-driven format, we decided that our next course,

122
00:06:57.720 --> 00:07:02.280
which is this course that you're taking right now, has to be in a story format.

123
00:07:02.950 --> 00:07:05.200
That way you'll know a context,

124
00:07:05.420 --> 00:07:09.600
the one that's given the story and why you need to learn certain concepts as

125
00:07:09.640 --> 00:07:12.720
a whole. So, in this course, you're going to join Bob,

126
00:07:12.860 --> 00:07:17.240
who is a brand new intern at a fictional company named Caleston Technologies.

127
00:07:18.060 --> 00:07:18.820
Now, Bob,

128
00:07:18.820 --> 00:07:23.720
the intern, is tasked to build and deploy an application for a client demo

129
00:07:23.750 --> 00:07:25.560
that, again, it's going to be in front of a client.

130
00:07:26.020 --> 00:07:30.400
Bob is new to Linux and faces numerous challenges while working on his Linux

131
00:07:30.500 --> 00:07:34.440
laptop and his Linux servers. So, what you'll do is that, in this course,

132
00:07:34.440 --> 00:07:36.560
you're going to join Bob in learning Linux,

133
00:07:36.670 --> 00:07:39.040
both through his eyes and throughout this course.

134
00:07:39.700 --> 00:07:43.120
So, you'll see how Bob explores the Linux operating system. You'll see him

135
00:07:43.220 --> 00:07:46.120
explore the terminal, and you'll start learning about the shell,

136
00:07:46.120 --> 00:07:48.680
which allows you to interact with the Linux kernel.

137
00:07:49.460 --> 00:07:51.640
You'll learn about core concepts of Linux,

138
00:07:51.770 --> 00:07:54.440
which are essential to understand how the Linux systems work.

139
00:07:54.780 --> 00:07:58.600
You're also going to be exploring a package management solution in different

140
00:07:58.630 --> 00:08:01.800
flavors of Linux. So, you get to see the different package managers,

141
00:08:01.940 --> 00:08:05.440
and this is what helps Bob to install and manage the required software on his

142
00:08:05.440 --> 00:08:08.280
system. Towards the end,

143
00:08:08.500 --> 00:08:12.480
Bob has enough experience in Linux to explore the command line even further.

144
00:08:13.060 --> 00:08:15.520
So, you learn about different types of text editors,

145
00:08:15.520 --> 00:08:17.040
you learn how to manipulate files,

146
00:08:17.460 --> 00:08:21.120
you learn about that sticky bit that I was talking about earlier, right?

147
00:08:21.340 --> 00:08:24.320
And then during a security review call, which happens in our story,

148
00:08:24.860 --> 00:08:27.400
Bob learns about the importance of security in Linux.

149
00:08:27.740 --> 00:08:31.480
He learns about file-level security. He learns about setting permissions,

150
00:08:31.820 --> 00:08:36.360
he learns about enabling systems at Linux for security. Now,

151
00:08:36.360 --> 00:08:37.800
while configuring applications,

152
00:08:38.100 --> 00:08:40.840
Bob is unable to connect to a database server from his laptop,

153
00:08:41.260 --> 00:08:45.520
and he learns how to troubleshoot new networking connectivity issues with

154
00:08:45.520 --> 00:08:49.000
assistance from his colleagues. At another point in the story,

155
00:08:49.220 --> 00:08:51.400
Bob runs out of space on his laptop.

156
00:08:51.700 --> 00:08:54.720
So, now, he has to learn how to configure storage on a Linux environment.

157
00:08:54.860 --> 00:08:57.080
He learns how to format disks, he learns how to mount them,

158
00:08:57.420 --> 00:09:00.280
as well as learning how to create logical volume groups, which is

159
00:09:00.560 --> 00:09:02.360
a storage construct inside Linux.

160
00:09:03.900 --> 00:09:08.280
Bob also at one point wants to run a custom application to like start up on the

161
00:09:08.280 --> 00:09:12.640
boot of his Linux laptop. So, he learns about System D has kind of

162
00:09:12.700 --> 00:09:16.600
an initializer for Linux and all the services that it can start.

163
00:09:16.980 --> 00:09:20.920
And what happens is that all of these skills that you walk through in the story,

164
00:09:20.920 --> 00:09:22.080
towards the end of the story,

165
00:09:22.510 --> 00:09:25.320
they help him deliver his projects towards the end.

166
00:09:25.420 --> 00:09:29.000
So, it basically enables him to do the demo in question.

167
00:09:30.060 --> 00:09:34.440
All of our lectures use visualization techniques and storytelling and analogies

168
00:09:34.820 --> 00:09:38.920
to simplify complex topics. These are going to make the concepts that we teach you

169
00:09:38.980 --> 00:09:40.120
not only easy to grasp,

170
00:09:40.340 --> 00:09:42.640
but it'll actually help you to remember them in the long term.

171
00:09:43.430 --> 00:09:47.320
Each lecture in this course is followed by a hands-on lab, so that way,

172
00:09:47.380 --> 00:09:51.640
you will learn, right, conceptualize, and then do, right?

173
00:09:51.740 --> 00:09:53.640
And this is all going to happen right up in your browser.

174
00:09:54.020 --> 00:09:56.440
So, there's no hassle of setting up environments to practice.

175
00:09:57.900 --> 00:10:01.800
You start practicing seconds after the lecture is complete, again,

176
00:10:02.030 --> 00:10:04.560
with the goal of this driving reinforcement.

177
00:10:04.740 --> 00:10:07.120
The labs are fun to work with and they give you challenges to solve.

178
00:10:07.500 --> 00:10:10.080
And once you solve these challenges where you put your, or

179
00:10:10.100 --> 00:10:11.080
submit your solution,

180
00:10:11.330 --> 00:10:14.640
we're going to validate your work and give you feedback on where you were right and

181
00:10:14.640 --> 00:10:17.000
where you went off the rails a little bit, where you went wrong.

182
00:10:17.580 --> 00:10:19.840
If you're not sure how to solve a problem,

183
00:10:20.100 --> 00:10:24.680
we have hints right in the lab that allow you to kind of get guided

184
00:10:24.710 --> 00:10:29.080
towards the solution. And the most important thing while learning Linux,

185
00:10:29.080 --> 00:10:31.720
especially the Linux command line, is practice.

186
00:10:32.180 --> 00:10:36.240
So, the hundreds of questions that are in our labs throughout this course are

187
00:10:36.240 --> 00:10:38.680
going to give you enough hands-on practice to be very,

188
00:10:38.680 --> 00:10:41.600
very confident in Linux and Linux basics.

189
00:10:41.980 --> 00:10:45.120
And here you are already ready to take the course. So, if you're ready,

190
00:10:45.570 --> 00:10:47.080
let's dive in. Let's get started.
