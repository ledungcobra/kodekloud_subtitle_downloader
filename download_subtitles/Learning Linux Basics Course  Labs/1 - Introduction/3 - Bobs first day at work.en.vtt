00:00:00.150 --> 00:00:03.810
ï»¿-June 24th. 6:55 AM.

2
00:00:05.310 --> 00:00:07.603
Bob is catching the early
morning train to

3
00:00:07.770 --> 00:00:11.190
the city for his first day
at Caleston Technology.

4
00:00:11.820 --> 00:00:16.693
"Nothing like an early morning train
ride to settle the nerves," he thinks.

5
00:00:16.860 --> 00:00:19.290
As the sunlight streams
through the window,

6
00:00:20.130 --> 00:00:22.740
the coach he is in is quite crowded.

7
00:00:23.310 --> 00:00:28.470
Bob recollects that the induction
will start at 9 AM at building A.

8
00:00:29.370 --> 00:00:34.690
"Plenty of time to grab a cup of coffee
and prepare for the day," he thinks.

9
00:00:35.250 --> 00:00:38.353
Lost in a trail of thought,
Bob was unaware

10
00:00:38.520 --> 00:00:41.850
of the person sitting across
who had been observing him.

11
00:00:44.010 --> 00:00:49.050
"Hi there. Are you new to the city?"
Bob was surprised.

12
00:00:49.470 --> 00:00:52.543
He looks over and sees a man,
who looked to be

13
00:00:52.710 --> 00:00:56.400
in his 50's,
dressed impeccably in a blue suit.

14
00:00:57.120 --> 00:01:00.390
"Hello, good morning," Bob replies.

15
00:01:01.050 --> 00:01:02.280
"My name is Bob.

16
00:01:03.060 --> 00:01:06.660
Yes, I am new here,
but how did you know that?"

17
00:01:07.710 --> 00:01:10.560
The stranger replies, "Look around,

18
00:01:10.920 --> 00:01:13.980
you are the only person
looking out of the window.

19
00:01:14.760 --> 00:01:18.493
People who take this train
every day would mostly be

20
00:01:18.660 --> 00:01:21.960
glued to their mobile phones
at this time of the day.

21
00:01:22.470 --> 00:01:27.960
No time to appreciate the true
beauty of the real world, I suppose,"

22
00:01:28.680 --> 00:01:29.680
he chuckled.

23
00:01:30.270 --> 00:01:33.660
Bob laughs, "I suppose that's true.

24
00:01:34.170 --> 00:01:36.570
I am hoping I will
be one of them soon."

25
00:01:37.350 --> 00:01:40.770
"Well, if that's what you really want.

26
00:01:41.430 --> 00:01:45.640
My name is Dave.
Nice to meet you," he says.

27
00:01:46.500 --> 00:01:49.783
Bob goes on to explain that
he is on his way to his

28
00:01:49.950 --> 00:01:54.390
first day at an IT company
called Caleston Technologies.

29
00:01:55.110 --> 00:02:00.010
Dave smiled,
"You are kidding," he said.

30
00:02:00.630 --> 00:02:03.090
"Well,
that's where I'm heading as well.

31
00:02:03.600 --> 00:02:07.170
I have been working there
for nearly 15 years now.

32
00:02:09.150 --> 00:02:12.973
Now that I think of it,
I remember reading an email that said

33
00:02:13.140 --> 00:02:16.800
a lot of people would be joining
the company by the month-end."

34
00:02:17.730 --> 00:02:22.260
Dave sticks out his hand.
"Wow, that is amazing,"

35
00:02:22.860 --> 00:02:26.250
Bob replies,
nervously shaking Dave's hand.

36
00:02:27.120 --> 00:02:30.157
"I am joining as a junior
frontend developer,

37
00:02:30.607 --> 00:02:33.210
and I am relatively new to IT."

38
00:02:33.990 --> 00:02:36.810
"Well, we all have to start somewhere.

39
00:02:37.320 --> 00:02:39.510
It is a great place to work.

40
00:02:39.840 --> 00:02:42.300
You will find that out very soon,"

41
00:02:43.020 --> 00:02:46.560
Dave says,
as the train stops at the station.

42
00:02:48.630 --> 00:02:50.190
"This is where we get off.

43
00:02:50.520 --> 00:02:53.520
Our office building
is just across the station.

44
00:02:53.970 --> 00:02:57.240
I think you would want to
head over to building A."

45
00:02:57.960 --> 00:03:01.030
"Yes, building A," nods Bob.

46
00:03:01.890 --> 00:03:07.960
"I have a WAR meeting in building
C in 15 minutes," Dave sighed.

47
00:03:09.120 --> 00:03:15.070
"It was great to meet you, and I'm sure
we will meet again soon. Good luck,"

48
00:03:15.720 --> 00:03:19.110
says Dave,
as he heads over to building C.

49
00:03:20.100 --> 00:03:24.360
"What a stroke of luck,"
Bob whispers to himself.

50
00:03:24.870 --> 00:03:27.283
"Meeting a colleague
even before stepping

51
00:03:27.450 --> 00:03:29.430
into the office for the first time.

52
00:03:30.330 --> 00:03:32.610
I wonder what a WAR meeting is?"

53
00:03:33.930 --> 00:03:37.240
He wonders what else lies
in store for him today

54
00:03:37.510 --> 00:03:43.500
as he walks towards the building A.
11:20 AM.

55
00:03:44.070 --> 00:03:46.500
The induction event
was pretty eventful.

56
00:03:47.070 --> 00:03:50.640
Bob was amongst 15 other
software professionals.

57
00:03:51.300 --> 00:03:53.683
He learned that his
new company Caleston

58
00:03:53.850 --> 00:03:57.965
Technologies had won several
key projects all over

59
00:03:58.132 --> 00:04:02.220
the world, specifically
in DevOps and Cloud technologies.

60
00:04:02.880 --> 00:04:07.800
Bob was very excited at the prospect
of being part of such projects.

61
00:04:08.910 --> 00:04:11.370
After learning about
the vision of the company,

62
00:04:11.580 --> 00:04:15.000
and several policies,
such as workplace safety

63
00:04:15.210 --> 00:04:19.573
and the anti-corruption Act,
which took 45 minutes, Bob

64
00:04:19.740 --> 00:04:24.000
heads down the IT floor to get
his key card and the laptop.

65
00:04:25.110 --> 00:04:29.550
After collecting the items,
he takes the elevator to the 8th floor.

66
00:04:30.210 --> 00:04:34.500
He was told to go to the desk at 8A001,

67
00:04:34.920 --> 00:04:37.350
where his new manager
Andrew would meet him.

68
00:04:38.040 --> 00:04:40.770
Bob finds the desk and settles down.

69
00:04:42.720 --> 00:04:46.260
"It's unboxing time," Bob thinks.

70
00:04:47.130 --> 00:04:50.863
The laptop was an 8th
generation i5 with

71
00:04:51.030 --> 00:04:56.773
128GB SSD hard disk, and 8GB of RAM.

72
00:04:56.940 --> 00:05:01.320
"A little short of disk space,
but not bad.

73
00:05:01.770 --> 00:05:05.260
Not bad at all," he thought.

74
00:05:06.030 --> 00:05:11.430
He powers on the laptop, expecting to
see the familiar Windows boot screen.

75
00:05:12.090 --> 00:05:16.273
He stares at the strange messages
being displayed across the screen

76
00:05:16.440 --> 00:05:19.920
for a couple of minutes,
not being able to comprehend them.

77
00:05:21.120 --> 00:05:24.810
"This is not Windows."
He thinks after a while.

78
00:05:25.560 --> 00:05:32.520
"Ah, it's a Linux System, Ubuntu.
Sweet." Bob is excited.

79
00:05:33.330 --> 00:05:37.123
In his previous company,
the only approved operating system

80
00:05:37.290 --> 00:05:43.320
for employee workstations was Windows
10 and in some cases, a Mac.

81
00:05:44.100 --> 00:05:46.920
He had limited experience
with Ubuntu though.

82
00:05:47.370 --> 00:05:51.480
As a hobby, Bob likes to
explore open-source software.

83
00:05:52.470 --> 00:05:55.093
Linux, being an open-source operating

84
00:05:55.260 --> 00:05:58.290
system is free
of licensing restrictions.

85
00:05:58.740 --> 00:06:02.683
Bob had installed it on a spare
personal computer and had got

86
00:06:02.850 --> 00:06:06.990
around the minimalistic graphical
user interface a few times.

87
00:06:08.190 --> 00:06:10.693
Once he logs in the first time using

88
00:06:10.860 --> 00:06:13.543
the initial credentials
provided by the IT

89
00:06:13.710 --> 00:06:17.473
support,
he sees a desktop interface that

90
00:06:17.640 --> 00:06:20.070
is significantly
different from Windows.

91
00:06:21.120 --> 00:06:23.143
He finds that the Windows equivalent

92
00:06:23.310 --> 00:06:26.760
of the taskbar is on the left-hand
side by default.

93
00:06:27.450 --> 00:06:31.950
It had come pre-installed with
apps such as thunderbird for mail,

94
00:06:32.310 --> 00:06:38.040
Mozilla Firefox, Libre Office Writer
as a replacement for Microsoft Word.

95
00:06:38.940 --> 00:06:41.610
There is an icon for Ubuntu Software.

96
00:06:42.030 --> 00:06:44.773
A quick look shows
all the basic programs

97
00:06:44.940 --> 00:06:48.570
that Bob might need,
such as Skype, and Slack.

98
00:06:49.320 --> 00:06:53.880
This seems a bit familiar from his
trial run on his personal computer.

99
00:06:55.620 --> 00:06:58.603
Bob was just about to
open the thunderbird email

100
00:06:58.770 --> 00:07:02.220
client when a tall figure
stopped by his desk.

101
00:07:02.910 --> 00:07:05.620
"You must be Bob. I am Andrew.

102
00:07:06.030 --> 00:07:09.520
We spoke over the phone the other day."
He said.

103
00:07:09.750 --> 00:07:13.680
"Hey, Andrew, how are you?"
Replies Bob.

104
00:07:14.340 --> 00:07:15.750
Shaking Bob's hand.

105
00:07:16.080 --> 00:07:20.890
"Doing very well, thanks."
"How was your induction?" Asks Andrew.

106
00:07:21.420 --> 00:07:24.240
"It went very well," replies Bob.

107
00:07:24.810 --> 00:07:27.840
"I learned a lot about
the company and the new projects.

108
00:07:28.200 --> 00:07:30.150
I think I remember a couple of them.

109
00:07:30.480 --> 00:07:36.000
The Project Mercury,
the Project Cannon," says Bob excitedly.

110
00:07:36.750 --> 00:07:39.870
"Excellent." Nods Andrew happily.

111
00:07:40.620 --> 00:07:43.920
"Yes, the Project Mercury
has been a big win for us

112
00:07:44.190 --> 00:07:48.150
and incidentally, that is the project
you will be working on.

113
00:07:48.780 --> 00:07:51.913
I hope you are ready
for a whole new world of cloud

114
00:07:52.080 --> 00:07:55.960
computing and DevOps technologies,"
says Andrew.

115
00:07:56.430 --> 00:08:00.640
"I sure am.
I am eager to learn," says Bob.

116
00:08:01.080 --> 00:08:07.360
"That's what I like to hear and you will
get to learn a lot here," says Andrew.

117
00:08:07.950 --> 00:08:11.580
Andrew observes that Bob
has logged in to his laptop.

118
00:08:12.060 --> 00:08:14.610
"Ah," exclaims Andrew.

119
00:08:15.090 --> 00:08:17.413
"I see you have already uncovered one

120
00:08:17.580 --> 00:08:19.980
of the surprises
I had in store for you.

121
00:08:20.280 --> 00:08:24.780
Now, I know you have primarily
worked on Windows in the past.

122
00:08:25.230 --> 00:08:28.003
However, with Project Mercury, we're

123
00:08:28.170 --> 00:08:30.763
focusing on a technology shift,
and we'll

124
00:08:30.930 --> 00:08:35.670
be looking to implement a lot
of DevOps and Cloud-Native tools,"

125
00:08:36.330 --> 00:08:37.330
adds, Andrew.

126
00:08:38.010 --> 00:08:41.773
He continues,
"With that in mind, we want all

127
00:08:41.940 --> 00:08:45.240
our engineers and developers
to get a taste of Linux.

128
00:08:45.840 --> 00:08:50.323
After all, the basic knowledge
of Linux in your arsenal will enable

129
00:08:50.490 --> 00:08:56.250
you to succeed as a DevOps engineer
in the long term." Bob agrees.

130
00:08:56.730 --> 00:09:01.470
"Absolutely.
This is a fantastic opportunity indeed,

131
00:09:01.860 --> 00:09:03.930
and I will try to make
the most out of it."

132
00:09:05.280 --> 00:09:10.350
"That's good to hear.
That's your first task. Learn Linux,"

133
00:09:10.920 --> 00:09:11.920
says Andrew.

134
00:09:12.360 --> 00:09:14.850
You won't have to start
from scratch though.

135
00:09:15.210 --> 00:09:17.630
The IT team would
have sent you an online

136
00:09:17.797 --> 00:09:20.083
self-start guide to understand

137
00:09:20.250 --> 00:09:24.060
the basics, specifically to get
started with the command line.

138
00:09:24.600 --> 00:09:27.780
That's the part most
new users struggle with.

139
00:09:28.200 --> 00:09:31.650
You can access it anytime
from the office network.

140
00:09:31.980 --> 00:09:36.000
It even has some nifty lab
exercises to help you learn.

141
00:09:36.840 --> 00:09:40.500
At the end of each chapter,
there is a mandatory test.

142
00:09:40.920 --> 00:09:44.550
Once you have completed this,
I will introduce you to Dave.

143
00:09:44.910 --> 00:09:48.403
He is the lead systems
engineer here and he would be

144
00:09:48.570 --> 00:09:51.900
more than happy to give
you some advanced lessons.

145
00:09:52.770 --> 00:09:55.320
"Dave," Bob gasps.

146
00:09:55.740 --> 00:10:00.270
"I think I already met him on the train
this morning," exclaims Bob.

147
00:10:00.750 --> 00:10:04.270
"Why am I not surprised?"
Laughs Andrew.

148
00:10:04.950 --> 00:10:07.020
"That man knows everyone."

149
00:10:07.530 --> 00:10:11.233
"Now I won't take up any
more of your time, but I want

150
00:10:11.400 --> 00:10:15.300
to emphasize that you take
the training very seriously.

151
00:10:15.600 --> 00:10:20.910
Your first project depends on it."
Bob nods nervously.

152
00:10:21.750 --> 00:10:24.930
"The quick start guide should help,
so start with that.

153
00:10:25.470 --> 00:10:29.953
We will meet again on Wednesday,
so please make sure you complete

154
00:10:30.120 --> 00:10:31.860
the first chapter by then."

155
00:10:32.430 --> 00:10:35.863
In fact,
I'm asking everyone in my team to

156
00:10:36.030 --> 00:10:40.273
complete the online test by tomorrow
evening, I will leave you to your

157
00:10:40.440 --> 00:10:46.350
draining good luck," says Andrew,
while walking away from the desk.

158
00:10:47.070 --> 00:10:50.503
As soon as Andrew leaves,
Bob opens Thunderbird

159
00:10:50.670 --> 00:10:54.180
and finds that his mailbox
has already been set up.

160
00:10:56.370 --> 00:11:00.763
Sure enough, there is an email
from the IT Support with

161
00:11:00.930 --> 00:11:04.380
a quick start guide on how
to use the new Linux OS.

162
00:11:05.280 --> 00:11:08.443
The email explained that
the quick start guide is meant to

163
00:11:08.610 --> 00:11:12.720
be used as a crash course
on how to use the Linux Shell.

164
00:11:13.620 --> 00:11:16.513
The guide consisted of two chapters,
both

165
00:11:16.680 --> 00:11:19.560
of which were accompanied
by hands-on labs.

166
00:11:20.100 --> 00:11:22.513
To mark the chapter complete, users

167
00:11:22.680 --> 00:11:25.710
had to complete
an online hands-on test.

168
00:11:26.190 --> 00:11:29.550
The first chapter had a due
date of June 26th.

169
00:11:30.210 --> 00:11:35.110
"Two days.
Let's get cracking then." Bob thinks.

170
00:11:35.880 --> 00:11:38.610
Bob reads through the rest
of the instructions.

171
00:11:39.000 --> 00:11:40.570
He observes that the terminal

172
00:11:40.737 --> 00:11:43.740
application is not
pinned to his taskbar.

173
00:11:44.340 --> 00:11:46.980
Bob follows one
of the tips from the guide.

174
00:11:47.520 --> 00:11:49.873
He clicks on the "Show Applications"

175
00:11:50.040 --> 00:11:54.630
Launcher, and then types in the word
terminal in the search bar.

176
00:11:55.290 --> 00:12:01.590
"There you go. I am in, this
is the part I really want to dig in."

177
00:12:02.250 --> 00:12:03.750
He thinks to himself.

178
00:12:04.320 --> 00:12:08.340
With that, Bob opens the first
chapter in the guide.
