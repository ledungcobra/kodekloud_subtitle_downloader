00:00:00.620 --> 00:00:01.680
"Oh, war room.

2
00:00:02.240 --> 00:00:05.780
The one place I did not want to ever be in,

3
00:00:06.100 --> 00:00:08.280
especially this early in my career."

4
00:00:08.760 --> 00:00:09.680
Bob thought.

5
00:00:10.460 --> 00:00:12.560
He felt as if he was on trial.

6
00:00:13.100 --> 00:00:16.360
The next few moments going to decide his fate.

7
00:00:17.440 --> 00:00:19.100
He takes a quick look at Andrew,

8
00:00:19.180 --> 00:00:21.100
who is pacing around nervously.

9
00:00:21.980 --> 00:00:23.300
"Not looking good.

10
00:00:23.720 --> 00:00:27.100
I have to fix this ASAP, or I might get fired.

11
00:00:27.700 --> 00:00:28.520
Thanks, Bob."

12
00:00:29.580 --> 00:00:32.260
The client demonstration was at 10:00 AM.

13
00:00:32.940 --> 00:00:34.760
Bob glances at his watch.

14
00:00:35.100 --> 00:00:37.220
It was 8:50 AM.

15
00:00:37.540 --> 00:00:39.000
A little more than an hour

16
00:00:39.040 --> 00:00:40.720
until the client demonstration.

17
00:00:41.680 --> 00:00:43.080
Bob shuttered at the thought

18
00:00:43.120 --> 00:00:45.280
of having nothing to show during the call.

19
00:00:46.040 --> 00:00:49.400
"I can not let my team down. What am I missing?

20
00:00:50.060 --> 00:00:52.060
I am sure the code is correct.

21
00:00:52.520 --> 00:00:55.080
Why isn't this darn thing working anymore?"

22
00:00:55.840 --> 00:00:59.200
Bob says, trying to open his web application.

23
00:00:59.940 --> 00:01:03.520
Is it the network? Is it some permission issue

24
00:01:04.060 --> 00:01:06.140
or was it something else entirely?

25
00:01:07.320 --> 00:01:10.780
He had no clue. He was panicking now.
