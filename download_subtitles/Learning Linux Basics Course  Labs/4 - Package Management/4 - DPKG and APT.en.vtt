00:00:00.770 --> 00:00:02.020
Dave continues.

2
00:00:02.250 --> 00:00:06.150
Now that we are familiar with the
rpm-based package managers

3
00:00:06.520 --> 00:00:09.800
let's check out the equivalent
on Debian distros

4
00:00:09.950 --> 00:00:14.470
such as Ubuntu, PureOS, Linux Mint, et cetera.

5
00:00:15.370 --> 00:00:17.670
Dave continues with the explanation.

6
00:00:18.420 --> 00:00:22.550
Here, we will look into dpkg
and apt specifically.

7
00:00:23.200 --> 00:00:28.400
dpkg stands for the Debian package
manager and similar to rpm,

8
00:00:28.500 --> 00:00:30.500
it is a low-level package manager.

9
00:00:32.150 --> 00:00:39.320
Similar to rpm, dpkg can be used
to install, remove, upgrade, list,

10
00:00:39.620 --> 00:00:41.200
and verify a package.

11
00:00:41.670 --> 00:00:44.400
The package extension is .deb.

12
00:00:45.220 --> 00:00:48.050
To install or update an existing package,

13
00:00:48.270 --> 00:00:52.720
use the dpkg-i command with
the package file name.

14
00:00:53.370 --> 00:00:56.250
To uninstall, use the -r flag.

15
00:00:57.250 --> 00:01:01.220
To list packages installed in the system
along with the version number

16
00:01:01.220 --> 00:01:04.570
in a short description, use the -l flag.

17
00:01:05.320 --> 00:01:10.620
Use the -s option to check the status of
the package if it is installed in the system.

18
00:01:11.520 --> 00:01:16.420
Finally, use the -p flag to display
details about packages

19
00:01:16.420 --> 00:01:20.000
such as version number, maintainer, et cetera.

20
00:01:22.570 --> 00:01:27.250
Similar to rpm, dpkg does not
honor the dependencies

21
00:01:27.250 --> 00:01:29.250
when it comes to package management.

22
00:01:29.420 --> 00:01:33.850
We saw earlier that an install may fail
due to dependencies issues.

23
00:01:34.550 --> 00:01:38.570
This is the reason why we use higher-level
Debian package managers

24
00:01:38.770 --> 00:01:41.070
such as apt and apt-get.

25
00:01:41.900 --> 00:01:46.150
of relying on dpkg, you can install software

26
00:01:46.150 --> 00:01:49.800
along with its dependencies
using apt or apt-get.

27
00:01:50.370 --> 00:01:55.350
Although it sounds similar, apt and apt-get
do not depend on each other.

28
00:01:56.370 --> 00:01:59.650
apt stands for advanced package managers

29
00:01:59.650 --> 00:02:04.370
is more user friendly and overall
a better tool compared to apt-get.

30
00:02:05.300 --> 00:02:07.920
his is the reason why we will focus on apt

31
00:02:07.920 --> 00:02:10.800
more than apt-get in the upcoming section.

32
00:02:13.470 --> 00:02:18.820
apt acts as a front end package manager
that relies on the dpkg utility,

33
00:02:19.120 --> 00:02:23.700
quite similar to the relation between
yum and rpm that we saw earlier.

34
00:02:24.600 --> 00:02:30.120
Similar to yum, apt relies on a software
repository that contains packages

35
00:02:30.420 --> 00:02:32.870
that would eventually
be installed on the system.

36
00:02:33.670 --> 00:02:35.950
The software repository for apt

37
00:02:36.220 --> 00:02:42.420
is defined in the /etc/apt/sources.list file.

38
00:02:43.200 --> 00:02:48.720
The source can be a local one such as
a directory on the file system or a CD-ROM,

39
00:02:49.350 --> 00:02:53.750
or it can be at a remote location
that is accessed via HTTP,

40
00:02:54.200 --> 00:02:58.000
HTTPS, or FTP transfer protocols.

41
00:03:00.950 --> 00:03:04.020
Let us now see some of the common apt commands.

42
00:03:04.670 --> 00:03:08.350
Run the apt update command
to refresh the repository.

43
00:03:08.870 --> 00:03:13.850
This command is used to download package
information from all available sources.

44
00:03:14.700 --> 00:03:18.970
A good time to run this would be
immediately after installing the OS

45
00:03:19.150 --> 00:03:21.250
or after adding new sources.

46
00:03:22.050 --> 00:03:26.520
The apt upgrade command can be
used to install available upgrades

47
00:03:26.520 --> 00:03:30.820
of all packages currently installed on
the system from the sources configured.

48
00:03:32.270 --> 00:03:37.650
You can also update the repositories
using the apt edit sources command.

49
00:03:38.250 --> 00:03:44.320
This opens up the /etc/apt/sources.list file

50
00:03:44.500 --> 00:03:48.150
in the text editor of your choice
such as vim or nano.

51
00:03:49.150 --> 00:03:54.300
Another way to add more repositories,
update the sources.list file

52
00:03:54.300 --> 00:03:57.870
directly using a text editor
such as the VI-editor.

53
00:04:00.650 --> 00:04:02.950
Once the repositories have been set up,

54
00:04:03.300 --> 00:04:06.050
you can make use of it to run apt commands.

55
00:04:06.500 --> 00:04:10.200
To install a package, run the
apt install command.

56
00:04:11.000 --> 00:04:14.500
Run the apt remove command
to remove the package.

57
00:04:15.120 --> 00:04:19.950
The apt search command can be used
to look for a package in the repository.

58
00:04:20.750 --> 00:04:26.070
You can also list all the available packages
using the apt list command.
