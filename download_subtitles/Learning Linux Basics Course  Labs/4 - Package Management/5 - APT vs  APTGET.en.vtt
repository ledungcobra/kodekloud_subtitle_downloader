1
00:00:00.580 --> 00:00:02.820
APT is a more user friendly tool

2
00:00:02.920 --> 00:00:04.340
compared to APT-GET.

3
00:00:04.920 --> 00:00:07.500
In all the latest WN-based distros,

4
00:00:07.700 --> 00:00:09.820
APT is already installed by default.

5
00:00:11.040 --> 00:00:12.580
Before we finish this session,

6
00:00:12.920 --> 00:00:15.420
let's take a quick look at why APT is better

7
00:00:15.500 --> 00:00:17.100
when compared to APT-GET.

8
00:00:17.840 --> 00:00:19.840
To do this, let's try to install

9
00:00:19.880 --> 00:00:21.260
the Firefox package

10
00:00:21.440 --> 00:00:23.620
using both APT and APT-GET.

11
00:00:24.680 --> 00:00:27.360
You will notice that APT is easy on the eyes.

12
00:00:27.700 --> 00:00:29.460
You get just enough information,

13
00:00:29.760 --> 00:00:32.160
and also a nice little progress bar.

14
00:00:33.420 --> 00:00:35.640
APT-GET, although just as effective,

15
00:00:36.140 --> 00:00:37.820
does not provide the output

16
00:00:37.920 --> 00:00:39.400
in a user friendly format.

17
00:00:42.360 --> 00:00:45.040
Let's try another comparison between the two

18
00:00:45.140 --> 00:00:47.400
by searching for a Telnet package.

19
00:00:48.080 --> 00:00:49.580
You will notice that with APT,

20
00:00:49.900 --> 00:00:52.680
all its options are located in one place.

21
00:00:53.100 --> 00:00:54.560
You can search for a command

22
00:00:54.660 --> 00:00:56.420
using the APT search command.

23
00:00:57.400 --> 00:00:58.200
On the other hand,

24
00:00:58.540 --> 00:01:00.180
you cannot search for a package

25
00:01:00.220 --> 00:01:01.940
using the APT-GET command.

26
00:01:02.560 --> 00:01:05.000
Instead, you have to use another tool

27
00:01:05.080 --> 00:01:08.100
called APT-CACHE with the search option.

28
00:01:09.180 --> 00:01:10.640
If you compare the results

29
00:01:10.680 --> 00:01:11.740
of the two commands,

30
00:01:12.020 --> 00:01:14.360
you will also see that APT-CACHE

31
00:01:14.620 --> 00:01:16.820
throws in a lot of extra information

32
00:01:16.880 --> 00:01:18.000
in the search result,

33
00:01:18.300 --> 00:01:20.000
which may not really be useful

34
00:01:20.060 --> 00:01:21.020
for the end-user.

35
00:01:22.120 --> 00:01:23.880
APT search, on the other hand,

36
00:01:24.280 --> 00:01:27.000
provides a shorter and more often than not,

37
00:01:27.180 --> 00:01:28.900
more useful results.
